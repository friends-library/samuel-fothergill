== Chapter IX.

The impressions made upon the mind of Samuel Fothergill by his visit to America,
were never obliterated;
his diligent labours there for the advancement of truth and righteousness--
his fervent desires that these labours might not be in vain,
but that, through the blessing of Him whom he desired to serve,
there might be brought forth fruit,
even an hundred-fold--his intercourse with Friends--his warm attachment to them--
the particular friendships formed with many--and the deep interest he ever
afterwards continued to feel for their welfare and their various concerns,
were subjects often predominant in his thoughts, and conspicuous in his correspondence.

Amongst those to whom Samuel Fothergill became
much attached whilst on his visit to America,
and whose minds were peculiarly affected by his ministry, was Samuel Emlen,
son of Joshua and Deborah Emlen, of Philadelphia.
He was endowed with great natural powers of mind,
with a peculiar readiness and fluency of expression,
and had received a liberal education, being well skilled in several languages.
He accompanied Samuel Fothergill on his return to Europe,
and an intimate friendship ever afterwards subsisted between them.

He was the companion of Abraham Farrington during part
of his religious visit to England and Ireland,
and at a meeting at Carlow he first appeared in the ministry.
In this service he travelled much on the American Continent;
he also visited the island of Barbados, and was several times in England,
where he travelled extensively, as well as in Ireland and Holland.

In 1772, he crossed the Atlantic, with John Woolman,
intending to pay a visit to his much-loved friend, Samuel Fothergill,
then in a weak state of health; they arrived in London at the time of the yearly meeting,
and when that was concluded, he hastened to Warrington; but ere he arrived there,
his friend was released from the bonds of mortality, and had entered into his rest.
Samuel Emlen attended the interment,
and was largely engaged in the ministry on that occasion.

His last visit to Europe was in 1796; he was not able to travel much,
but spent most of the time in Dublin and in Lancashire,
visiting the meetings and families of Friends very acceptably,
thus setting the seal to his previous abundant labours in England and Ireland.

Upon his return home in 1797, the health of Samuel Emlen became much impaired;
his constitution was naturally weak and infirm,
and from this period he gradually declined.
A short time before his decease, being at a meeting at Philadelphia,
whilst engaged in a lively testimony, he was seized with violent pain;
leaning for support on the rail of the gallery, he pathetically repeated these lines: --

[verse]
____
"`My life, if thou preserv`'st my life,
Thy sacrifice shall be;
And death, if death must be my doom,
Shall join my soul to thee.`"
____

He departed this life on the 30th of twelfth month, 1799, aged nearly seventy years,
having been a minister forty-two years.
His interment was attended by a large assemblage of his friends and fellow citizens,
of all ranks and degree.

During the last visit of Samuel Emlen to Europe, he spent much time at Warrington,
and was accustomed often to advert to the
labours of his departed friend Samuel Fothergill,
and to the powerful and awakening tendency of his ministry.
He would frequently visit the house in which his friend had lived,
(it was then occupied by the editor`'s parents,) and describe
and expatiate upon the hours they had there passed together:
he also related several interesting passages and circumstances
connected with Samuel Fothergill`'s visit to America;
amongst others,
the following:--That during a visit which he paid to a
few Friends scattered in the back parts of Pennsylvania,
they had to endure much hardship, were sometimes obliged to pass the night in the woods,
having the sky for their canopy, their travelling cloaks for covering,
and using their saddles for pillows.
Late one night, they arrived at a solitary house, in a lonely place;
here they requested lodgings for the night, which were granted.
They found that the house and extensive farm around it belonged to an individual,
the mistress of many servants employed upon the land; she was of masculine character,
and strong powers of mind, but of an unregenerate heart,
much under the influence of unsubdued passions, and greatly addicted to profane swearing.
Samuel Fothergill told his companion, that from what he had observed,
he thought her the most wicked woman he had ever seen.
She nevertheless treated them with civility, and even kindness.
The situation of the family, with such a character for its head,
caused some exercise of mind to Samuel Fothergill,
and in the morning he requested that the household might be collected,
and that they might sit down together; this was complied with,
and the whole family was assembled.
He addressed them in a remarkable manner,
and in particular he was led to lay open the wickedness
of the human heart in its unregenerate state,
and the awful consequences of remaining in such a state;
his language and expressions were so powerful,
that the mistress of the house was greatly affected, her spirit was broken,
and she wept much.

After this, feeling at liberty, the Friends prepared to depart,
they took leave of the family, and desired to pay for their entertainment.
She refused to accept anything,
but said they were quite welcome to everything they had had; adding,
that she was unworthy to receive such guests under her roof;
and so powerfully had the word preached wrought upon her heart, that she exclaimed,
"`You are angels, but I am a devil!`"

Another circumstance was related by Samuel Fothergill himself,
of a Friend at whose house he had lodged when passing through the wilderness.
These thinly peopled back settlements were then much infested by wolves,
and she told him of a remarkable deliverance which she
had once experienced from these ferocious animals.

She was a widow, and lived with her son, who cultivated a small piece of land,
which furnished them with a frugal subsistence.
Their nearest neighbour, who lived a few miles distant, through the forest,
came early one afternoon, to request she would visit his wife,
who was suddenly taken very ill, and stay with her while he went for medical advice.
With this she complied,
and putting up in a basket a few needful things for the sick woman,
she told her son she did not expect to return before the next morning,
and set out and reached the place in safety.

With suitable remedies, the invalid soon recovered, and her husband coming speedily back,
the widow concluded to return home that evening, hoping,
as it was a fine moonlight night, that she might pass the forest without danger; but,
on crossing an open glade,
she saw a company of wolves drinking at a pool of water at some distance,
which made her sensible of her great rashness and imprudence, knowing,
that unless she could pass unobserved, her destruction was inevitable,
as no human help was at hand; for though her home was now in sight, she could not get in,
believing her son would be in bed, and the cottage fast.
In this strait, she lifted up her heart to God, in earnest prayer, that He,
who had often strengthened and consoled her in many troubles,
would now be pleased to interpose for her help,
and that as she was returning from a work of charity,
he would not permit her to be devoured by these savage creatures;
her mind became composed, and she ran quickly forward: on crossing the fence,
she looked back, and perceived that one of the wolves had raised his head,
and discovered her; he uttered a shrill cry,
and immediately the whole pack was in pursuit.

Meanwhile, her son, not expecting her, had retired to rest, but he could not sleep;
a strange and unusual anxiety came over his mind, which continually increased; he got up,
and made a large fire of wood, which blazed brightly, by which he sat down;
in a short time he thought he heard his mother`'s voice calling to him,
and opening the door, he perceived her, followed by several wolves;
one was so near as almost to touch her shoulder with his paw.
The sudden light dazzled and checked them, and for a moment they fell back,
which gave her time to rush into the house and close the door, when she, with her son,
both greatly affected by this deliverance,
united in returning thanks for the merciful interposition
which had so remarkably preserved her life.

Eighth month 1st, 1756.

I affectionately salute thee in a degree of that love which hath often mutually united,
and raised desires for the preservation and establishment of
each other in these days of dissipation,
when so few come up to the solemn feasts: and dear friend,
our experience may teach us humblingly comfortable lessons of
the faithfulness and truth of our heavenly Father.
How hath he sustained in trials, within and without! when the billows rolled high,
his arm supported; and when the diffident heart was ready to say,
"`I shall no more see him in the land of the living,`"
he hath renewed his presence to us as the morning light.
Our duty, our greatest duty is, humbly to follow on to know Him; to abide under his holy,
redeeming hand;
that every branch which would sprout out of his holy counsel may be early removed; thus,
I believe, a happy equanimity of spirit might be more generally known,
and perhaps less of that deep suffering which sinks beneath the happy medium.
I am afraid deep sufferings and baptisms must be known
by all who retain their place in the Lamb`'s army;
but such is the equity and truth of our Captain, that if patience have her perfect work,
his true followers, even through the region of the shadow of death, fear no evil.
May the Stay of the righteous in every generation thus direct our steps,
in the midst of the paths of judgment, to the honour of his cause,
the dignifying his name, and to our own peace.

I rejoice to hear of thy dear mother`'s agreeable state of health,
and more so to understand the decline is made tolerable and easy,
by an increase in that which remains when nature fails,
and is the enduring riches of all who are happy.
She has been long convinced of a fixed truth, and now feels its sweetness,
that religion is the stay of life, and the greatest comfort of its close.

I am, through mercy, pretty well in health, calm in spirit, though much emptied.
I know it is right, and may every residue of corruption, be searched out and removed.
I can beg for sanctification through the spirit of judgment and of burning,
and the degrees of glorification will be justly attained.

Warrington, Third month 6th, 1756.

With a heart replenished with strong emotions of gratitude to the great Preserver of men,
whose excellent name is the abiding defence of his people, and their sure munition,
I affectionately salute thee, thy dear wife and children, for whom,
not only from motives of gratitude, but the uniting cement of the family,
I wish every degree of essential happiness.

Under the protection of the Holy hand, we arrived safe at Dublin, the 9th of last month,
but I could not reach my own habitation until the 29th, being detained by contrary winds.
But as service offered, and renewing of strength to perform it,
I was preserved from much impatience,
and have cause to believe our return by Dublin
was in the wisdom and by the direction of Heaven.

I found all well at home, my dear wife fully as healthy as when I left her;
and had awful occasion to acknowledge,
not one word of the Lord respecting me or mine hath fallen to the ground.
May it ever be awfully marvellous in mine eyes,
and engage in prompt obedience to every succeeding call to service.
O that I may be preserved to be remembered in the household, by the great Master,
and his will respecting the labour, not mine, be done.

I am, at present, much restricted for time to write, but may just say,
I am returned in peace, can review my labour amongst you at least with ease;
and He who drew forth has caused the angel of
his presence to be nigh at hand upon my return.
I have nothing to rejoice in, but abundant condescension:
nor doth any gloomy cloud of distress intercept my prospect of the heavens.
Various are the prospects of the skies, according to the time of day;
but if the dark clouds arise not from our own misconduct,
we may awake and arise from them, and see the holy likeness.

Warrington, Eighth month 10th, 1756.

No expressions are capable of setting forth the variety of trials, painful labour,
and exercise, which, within and without, have attended me, since, this day two years,
we parted at Gravesend; but I may say, with a deeply reverent heart,
equally unalterable have been the sure mercies of our Heavenly Father and helper,
before whom our darkness and weakness is open and known,
and his saving arm of power magnified in the greatest distress.
He hath graciously preserved, and helped, and kept, to return in peace and safety,
when others of his precious servants have laid down their lives,
far from endeared relatives.
O that it may evermore be awfully marvellous in my eyes.
I believe my going was in His wisdom, and have cause to believe my return was so likewise.
I found work to do at Dublin while I stayed,
not without lively evidence that I was where I ought to be--and that is enough.

I believe we parted on the 10th of eighth month, 1754, and this is its anniversary;
two years are revolved and lapsed, but I trust they are not lost,
but have been employed to future advantage; at least my own,
if I be enough bowed in heart to live near that Hand,
which is the glorious supporter of all who bear its refining and turnings; I am calm,
quiet, and easy, not returned with the rapturous fruition of heavenly riches;
they are locked up in the celestial treasury,
and one wiser than I keeps the key I have gratefully to acknowledge,
He who is one of a thousand, hath been comfortably near to my spirit,
as a holy stay and quiet rest; I have an evidence of acceptance,
and that I have been where, and done what I ought.
But it is conveyed in the still small voice,
which requires very deep and silent listening, and not in the rapturous whirlwind.

Good and wise is He with whom we have to do; oh, may we labour,
with diligence and steady patience, to be meet for a place amongst his own children,
who have their bread in due season,

Lancaster, Eighth month 13th, 1756.

Yea, thankful I am that thou hast been favoured with health,
and every way preserved to perform such a long, heavy, trying journey,
and to return in safety with peace in thy bosom,
and which I hope will rest upon thee like dew, to thy lasting refreshment,
comfort and satisfaction, of which thy dear wife will also have a share;
for she has been a true fellow traveller with thee, in a feeling sense of close sympathy,
and hath borne thy absence in a most prudent manner,
with much fortitude and Christian patience, and becoming cheerfulness.

When we heard of thy arrival at Dublin it made many glad hearts.
I have often thought our quarterly meeting looked naked and weak without thee,
yet Providence hath graciously condescended to our help and joy of faith.

I have lately beard that Friends have had another
opportunity with the chief of the Jersey Indians,
since thou came away, who seemed well satisfied with the conversation of Friends,
and said they had now a different apprehension of Friends,
having had their acquaintance mostly with the new-light Presbyterians.
Many of them went with Friends to their meeting on first-day,
and were much tendered under Truth`'s testimony.

Dudley, Eighth month 14th, 1756.

Solitude seems so much my choice, as well as safety,
and my present business seems to be so much at home, that I am willing to look at it,
being very desirous that I may not move out of my place,
and so destroy that peace I am at present favoured with.

I am not, my dear friend, insensible that we are frequently (I had almost said,
most frequently,) the cause of that distress of mind we feel,
and hope earnestly to press after a state of perfect resignation to the Divine will.
I believe there is such a state of rectitude and strength to be attained,
as that we shall not be greatly moved either by outward or inward trials,
in which attainment I know myself but too deficient; but through mercy,
I have a heart that loves instruction, though it comes in judgment,
and that has frequently prayed that the Almighty
might not spare the rod when it was necessary,
by which, as well as the staff, I have been comforted; yea,
I have been fully willing that the righteous justice of God should be exerted,
and if for any transgression I was cast into prison,
I might remain there the appointed time.
But, through his grace, I dare hope for a degree of liberty, which I already feel;
and may my eye be ever kept humbly watchful,
that my flight may neither be in the winter nor on the sabbath day.

Warrington, Tenth month 26th, 1756.

It hath not been the effect of forgetfulness,
that I have not before this time written to thee, from this, the land of my nativity;
but a variety of outward affairs, to which prudence required my attention,
and some employment relative to the Society, may plead my excuse;
especially to one who knows I dearly love him,
although I cannot tell him so at all times.
It is surely when the warmth of this holy union prevails,
that correspondence is most truly beneficial.

I am returned home in safety; and though I feel no rapturous enjoyment of riches,
yet pretty much exempt from outward blame,
in the close review and examination of my progress in your land.
Although the rod, as well as the staff, are the wise allotments of our Heavenly Father,
and to me equally necessary,
yet I find it safe to endeavour after steadfast dependence upon Him,
with whom alone is salvation.
I have sometimes a glimpse of more openness,
and the more sensible testimony of acceptance.
But may I seek more worthiness, for I have more than I merit.
The western counties appointed their yearly meeting at Warwick this year.
It was large, and I believe, upon the whole, satisfactory.
Catharine Payton had very acceptable service; but, between ourselves,
I had a painful prospect and feeling of the present state of the ministry amongst us;
yea, more so than ever before.
My sister Ann met me at Warwick, and I went with her to London,
and much rejoiced to see her and the Doctor,
not solely from motives of natural affection, but for the Truth`'s sake which is in them,
and in which I hope they have grown in my absence.
May the Lord of perfection carry on his own work, until they and we are entire,
wanting nothing.
It is many years since I was in that city, at any other time than at the yearly meeting,
and was pretty much a stranger to the state of things amongst them,
which I found lamentably low;
upon a view of those who might be instrumental in rebuilding the waste places,
one cannot avoid a cry, "`O Lord, by whom shall Jacob arise?`"

I found in almost every mind a secret displeasure against the
Friends who signed the epistle of caution and advice;
and fully expected to be tried by the Meeting for Sufferings, for being concerned in it.
But innocently conscious of my own and friends`' integrity,
and mindful of that which engaged us, I was quiet, and yet bold.
I have this remark to make,
although subscribing that epistle hath made me the butt of professor and profane,
I never once repented it; I believe it was right, and leave the effect to Him,
whose ways are unsearchable, yet faithful, just and true.

The Friends who are among you from Europe, will, I hope, be guided aright;
they have great need to ask wisdom of Him whose gifts are perfect;
many here expect they will condemn that epistle, and censure the Friends who signed it;
some think otherwise; but it is the promotion of Truth itself, (not our names,
and our own honour,) my soul begs.
I have not hitherto received a line from any Friend in America,
except two from Rhode Island.
You are many of you very near to my life, and fresh in remembrance:
methinks I should be sorry to be entirely forgotten,
though I had rather that was the case,
than that the message I had to deliver in my
Heavenly Master`'s name should be written in dust.
I am often with you in spirit and true sympathy; the clouds seem black,
and filled with tempest;
happy is it for those who have a Refuge to flee to in time of storm,
even the ancient enduring fortress of the righteous, the strong tower of David.

This nation seems in a ferment, and likely to come to distress; a scarcity of bread,
and various losses; a divided people, and many enemies amongst ourselves;
and what is most to be lamented, our crying iniquities cut us off from Divine favour,
as it may justly be feared.
These things seem to me to portend a cause of humiliation,
perhaps more awfully alarming than any thing we have long met with.
I cannot divest myself of pain for my native land, as an inhabitant of it,
nor yet a remembering our multiplied offences against the Lord of heaven and earth,
or desire a breach in the uniformity of his attributes,
by his withholding punishment from those who have despised and abused his mercies,
and mocked at his gentle correction.
With respect to my health, it is not so good as in your country;
a pretty frequent cause of complaint in my breast hath attended me,
and hath been one cause of my silence, writing much being painful.

Our honourable and aged friend, David Hall, departed this life a few weeks ago,
having been some time indisposed, but went off suddenly at last,
though I fully believe in a happy preparation for that rest which is glorious.

I must draw to a conclusion,
with the salutation of dear love in our holy Head and High Priest,
which extends over sea and land, and is stronger than death;
may we be made and preserved such sanctified vessels, as often to be replenished thereby,
and be preserved, in times of withdrawing, chaste and dependent,
that our fruit may be on us every month, in the variety of seasons in the Lord`'s year.
My dear wife is bravely, and joins with me in the most affectionate tenders of true love.

Warrington, Tenth month 26th, 1756.

In a fresh sense of that love and pure friendship in which our
spirits have been at times mutually refreshed and united,
I very affectionately salute thee, ardently wishing for thee, as for myself,
an increase with the increase of God, and that whereunto we have already attained,
we may hold fast without wavering,
and persevere in that path which hath been mercifully cast up for us,
and is indeed the path of peace.

Many are the difficulties and trials through which lies our passage to rest;
and that the souls of a remnant know right well.
Yet with equal certainty have they to rejoice in All-sufficiency,
and make His most excellent name their song in the house of their pilgrimage.
The main and proper business of every traveller, who would succeed in his journey,
is to keep close to his Guide, whether the road be joyous or more afflicting.
Sometimes, by endeavouring to take a shorter, and at other times an easier path,
people have insensibly wandered away, and gone on without going forwards,
and their mistake been fatal.
Sometimes a smooth path has, by its seeming straight direction,
and contiguity to the right one, diverted us from arduous labour,
and we have been induced to choose present ease, at the expense of true peace;
and the danger of final miscarriage hath been hid for a time,
but at last appeared with awful weight;
happy where timely enough to retrieve the mistakes
resulting from former indolence or inattention.
We live in a benumbing climate, and every hour brings with it a torpedo,
to stupify our right hand.
Though, dear friend,
I am not jealous of any peculiar necessity for
the application of the above hints to thee,
yet I am so conscious of their relation to myself, that I cannot well omit them,
as they flow unsought for, not unfelt.

That ancient cord of love, which binds up in the heavenly bundle of love and life,
is often around my spirit, in sympathy and fellowship with some of yours;
though a debility of mind often is my lot,
in which I am disqualified from much expression,
and sometimes have no right to express any thing.
I have been much divested of the sense of heavenly treasure in my own possession,
since my return, but am thankful for a resigned, quiet spirit,
which I feel is not insensible stupidity; and all I beg for is,
to be remembered and replenished, in the wise proportions of His knowledge,
who keeps the windows of heaven shut as it pleaseth him, and opens when he sees meet.
I am poor, yet not void of hope at times, and I thank my Heavenly Master I am content,
I rarely open my state, but to Him who can relieve and supply;
but it may not be discouraging to thee to know
there are others poor and needy besides thyself.

We seem in great agitation in this kingdom,
and perhaps on the eve of some national calamity.
Few, very few, lay it to heart.
Destruction and bloodshed seem the principal topic of converse,
but the real enemy and great destroyer is cherished as a friend.
I think there seems an increase in wickedness in this land,
and it appears to draw fast down a stroke from that Hand,
which will make its own way in the earth, and be magnified in righteousness.
I do not expect your present situation is the most pleasing; but oh,
that the Rock of the righteous, and their dwelling-place throughout all generations,
may be our fortress, for the clouds seem heavy with a tempest.

Warrington, Eleventh month 9th, 1756.

[.salutation]
Dear and worthy friend.

As I am persuaded thou hast greatly at heart the welfare of Zion,
and in a particular manner art interested in me,
having discharged the office of a father to me in my minority,
with a father`'s regard and tenderness, I take up my pen to salute thee and thy dear wife,
my worthy and honoured friend, whom as well as thyself,
I still remember with distinguished, yea, filial regard; and can assure thee and her,
though I have not made many professions of affection and esteem,
there are few living to whom I bear an equal share,
or who are the more frequent companions of my most affectionate remembrance.

A variety of labour, in which our heavenly and blessed Father hath engaged me,
hath very much confined my mind to the service of the day,
and rendered it necessary for friendship to give place to duty;
so that my correspondence hath been but little, though, I hope,
in the hidden root of immortal life,
I am made a partaker of the fellowship of the brotherhood.
But this, with the poverty and leanness which have been much my lot,
hath laid the finger of silence upon my lips, and stopped my pen.
I thought I found at least a liberty this evening to assure thee of my regard,
and give thee some little account of myself, my labours abroad, and how, upon the whole,
I apprehend the state of the Society is in those parts where my lot hath been cast.
Through mercy,
I have to acknowledge I was favoured with a more
confirmed state of good health than usual,
two short interruptions excepted.
I travelled with diligence, and at times pretty hard labour;
and as I passed through various provinces, I may give thee a hint how I fared,
and found things in each.

To begin with Pennsylvania, where I landed.
There are a very great body of people who bear our name, and many who deserve to bear it.
A noble seed, of several classes respecting age, though too few of the aged amongst them,
who have kept their garments clean, and whose hands are strong.
Their fathers came into the country in its infancy,
and bought large tracts of land for a trifle;
their sons found large estates come into their possession,
and a profession of religion which was partly national,
which descended like the patrimony from their fathers, and cost as little.
They settled in ease and affluence,
and whilst they made the barren wilderness as a fruitful field,
suffered the plantation of God to be as a field uncultivated, and a desert.
Thus, decay of discipline and other weakening things prevailed,
to the eclipsing of Zion`'s beauty; yet was there a noble remnant, whose love was strong,
and who remembered the Lord of the whole earth and his house,
whilst they built their own.

A people who had thus beat their swords into plough shares,
with the bent of their spirits to this world,
could not instruct their offspring in those statutes they had themselves forgotten.
As every like begets its like, a generation was likely to succeed,
formed upon other maxims,
if the everlasting Father had not mercifully extended a visitation,
to supply the deficiency of their natural parents.

It consisted with his wisdom and mercy to reach forth a
hand of love to many of them of the younger sort,
and to subject their hearts to the work of his own power;
and more especially of later time, he hath prevailed upon many in that province;
brought some into the ministry, some fitting for it; and I trust for many,
who are like the little sister,
who hath no breasts to give to others the sincere milk of the Word,
he is building them up as a wall, upon which a palace of silver may be reared.
I cannot but hope in that province, particularly in the city of Philadelphia,
it may be said Truth prospers,
and there is a prospect that the succeeding generation may excel the last.
I visited all their meetings, not as running hastily through them,
but with great circumspection, and some of them four, five, or six times over,
being desirous to leave them in peace.

Maryland is poor; the gain of oppression,
the price of blood is upon that province-- I mean their purchasing,
and keeping in slavery, negroes--the ruin of true religion the world over,
wherever it prevails.
Friends there are greatly decreased in number, and mixed with the world,
in whose spirit they dwell.
Their unfaithfulness to their testimony against the hireling priests,
and their hands polluted with the gains of unrighteousness,
have almost destroyed even the appearances of Truth in various parts;
and as the pure gift of the ministry cannot be communicated to such unclean vessels,
there is a great scarcity of ministers.
I know not more than two in the province on whom is the heavenly stamp visible,
and they are neither negro keepers nor priest payers.
Nevertheless, in this Sardis the blessed Hand is at work.
Some are lately convinced, and among the rising youth are some of the true Hebrew race,
who have heard the alarm of the heavenly trumpet, and come out of their dens and caves.

This very much describes also the state of Virginia; only I think I may add,
the visitation of Divine truth seems more effectually received
in various parts of this province than the former,
and a spring of living ministry to edification;
but here the youth are those whom the King of heaven delights to honour.

North Carolina is the next.
There are a great many Friends in a part of it contiguous to Virginia;
some truly valuable Friends, but few;
yet many who offer a sacrifice of that which cost them nothing.
The largest body of Friends here seems to me the weakest; they have been a lively people,
but negro purchasing comes more and more in use amongst them,
and the pure life of Truth will ever proportionably decay.
I travelled twelve hundred miles in this province, amongst Friends and others,
and found some brethren and true members ingrafted into the Vine;
though worldly mindedness and lukewarmness have seized upon many.

South Carolina hath only two meetings; one at Charleston,
where there are few who bear our name, and fewer who deserve it;
yet such is the force of our Divine testimony, as to gain place among the people.
I had several very open meetings there, particularly two in the Baptist meeting-house,
to great satisfaction.
The principal people of the province attended,
and the Lord of all mercies magnified his eternal name.
The other is one hundred and thirty miles distant; a pretty settlement of Friends,
mostly from Ireland.

I went thence to Georgia, and had a large meeting in the court-house,
and some opportunities in the inn where I lodged, to some service,
though there were not any there who bore our name.

I returned through the several provinces, as Truth opened my way;
had sundry meetings in the county court-houses, and some of their places of worship;
and finished my visit to Friends, where I had omitted any meetings in my going south;
and upon my return rested a few days at Philadelphia.

The Jerseys were the next in course; I had much close labour there;
there is a valuable body of Friends, but much chaff,
though I trust things are upon the revival.
Long Island contains a great body of Friends; some truly valuable,
but the more aged have not walked as bright examples;
the leaders of the people have caused them to err.
I visited this island four times, and left it at last with a pained heart,
to which the want of a hopeful prospect of things being better greatly contributed.
Narraganset and Rhode Island were then in my course.
I had much close labour amongst them;
this world has intercepted their prospect of a better,
and greatly impaired that beauty which once rested on them, or their ancestors,
though I hope there remains a little remnant upright,
with their lamps trimmed and burning.
But, alas! the number of the faithful is there but as the gleaning of the vintage;
I met with few places more discouraging.
Thence, I went to Nantucket, a late plantation in comparison with many others,
but too few there have kept their first love; divisions and contentions,
the certain companions of the spirit of this world, have hurt them;
and as these have subsisted amongst the leaders of the people,
their example hath been injurious to others.
Yet, even here, hope remained, from a prospect of a rising generation coming up,
to assert a testimony their fathers have forgotten or neglected.

Boston government was the next place where I found continual occasion of sorrow,
yet intermixed with some hope.
I had abundant labour, both with the natural branches of the olive tree,
and those without.
In that Aceldama, or field of blood,
I was greatly favoured in many open and very large meetings,
to publish the everlasting Gospel with some success, to my humble admiration,
and thankful acknowledgment to the ever worthy Name.
The state of the Society in this province is affecting.
What open persecution could not effect,
has been too fully accomplished by the caresses and favours extended to Friends there;
nevertheless, there are a body of lively Friends up and down, who, I trust,
walk in white.

I returned through Narraganset, Rhode Island, and Long Island, into New York government;
where, though cause of sorrow appeared,
yet it was not void of hope for many amongst them, whose faces are set Zionwards.
In the city of New York is a small, but very valuable body of Friends,
who grow in the Truth as it is in Jesus.

I returned to the yearly meeting at Philadelphia, ninth month, 1755,
which was very large, and truly comfortable.
The winter I spent in close labour in Pennsylvania, and through Jersey,
to my relief and ease of spirit.
And although very painful baptisms attended me,
yet the overshadowing of a rock which was higher than I,
preserved in summer`'s heat and winter`'s storms;
and graciously supplied for every time of want;
and mercifully sustained with ability to bring forth fruit in every month,
throughout the revolution of the Lord`'s glorious year.

I mention it to the praise of his most excellent Name, for righteousness belongs to him,
but to me blushing and confusion of face;
inward and outward salvation was the merciful and unmerited bounty of his hand;
he stayed me in humble reverence, when I came to the festival days of Mount Zion,
and preserved me in patience, when I pensively mused on the scroll,
written within and without, with mourning, lamentation, and woe.

Excuse the tediousness of this epistle.
I did not expect it when I sat down;
but my heart is touched with a lively sense of Divine condescension,
and gratefully worships Him, not one of whose words hath fallen to the ground.
I have nothing to glory in, and am weak; I have known strength.
I am foolish.
I have been helped with wisdom.
I am poor, but have been enriched.
The rod I have often merited; the staff hath been often revealed.
I have nothing; I am nothing; let the gain and praise be consecrated to Him,
whose is the fulness of all wisdom, riches, and strength.

Farewell, my dear and honourable friend.
May that arm which hath been thy succour, and the strength of thy youth and middle age,
be near in the decline of life,
perfect everything necessary to be done to
qualify for converse with the saints in light,
and keep by its mighty power to the last moment.
May the close of thy well-run race be joyful:
and when access is vouchsafed to the throne of grace, remember poor me,
who may have yet a larger portion of the slippery course before me,
that I may be enabled so to run as to obtain,
and be preserved a monument of unutterable mercy to the end.
Thy very affectionate friend,

Blackwater, in Virginia, Twelfth month 8th, 1756.

I should have been glad to have seen thee before thou left this continent,
but it seems to me it was for the best that we had no personal communion with each other,
for some in Nantucket were so weak as to imagine I had seen the
letter thou wrote to Friends there The difference is not closed,
and I fear it will be to the hurt of many.

Thy labour for the renewing of the discipline seems to gall many stubborn ones,
but causeth joy to those who are bowed in spirit for Zion`'s welfare;
so that there is hope Truth may yet gain the ascendancy, and the church,
which long hath had her place in the wilderness, as a lily amongst thorns, will,
in the husband`'s time, become the beauty of nations,
and Jerusalem the praise of the whole earth.

Friends were much distressed about training, in New England and New York governments;
and though some could not suffer,
yet a good number were faithful in the testimony
they were called to bear on behalf of their Lord;
who said, "`My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, then would my servants fight,
that I should not be delivered to the Jews;`" so that if, as servants of Christ,
they could not fight for their Master`'s life, much less for their own lives;
and if not fight, not train, nor pay others to do that for them,
which they believe they should not do, either for their Master or themselves.
It is likely the state of Pennsylvania will be given thee by another hand,
yet thus much I may say, the yearly meeting was a good, profitable meeting to many.

I hope thou wilt sometimes remember me, a poor traveller in these perilous times,
with desires that fortitude and wisdom from on high may be my armour,
whilst I have to pass through the broken ranks of these hosts,
where sword is set against sword, and the divisions are so great,
even amongst the first born sons of Jacob;
for which my heart and bowels are pained within me.

Thomas Gawthorp.

--

Thomas Gawthorp, a fellow-labourer with Samuel Fothergill, in America,
was born at Skipton, in 1709.
His father dying when he was young, he was put an apprentice;
and meeting with severe treatment, he, to get free from it, enlisted into the army.

Whilst in that service, he attended a meeting at Skipton,
wherein his mind was so affected by the powerful ministry of Mary Slater,
that from that time forward he continued to attend
Friends`' meetings as opportunities offered,
and was brought into great exercise of mind on account of his situation;
yet he was not at liberty to have his discharge purchased,
fearing that he might not stand his ground: one of the officers, observing his distress,
made him an offer of his release, upon payment of the money paid to him when he enlisted;
this, on solid consideration, he accepted, and left the army.

Soon after this he married Isabel Crosfield, and settled near Kendal,
and in a short time came forth in the ministry;
"`his mind being devoted to the service of his great Master,
and obedient to the manifestations of Truth, he grew in the gift received,
and became a deep and able minister of the gospel; diligently labouring,
in the openings of life,
for the exaltation of Truth in the hearts of the people,`"
often having close and pertinent counsel to deliver,
well adapted to their different states; "`not in the wisdom of man,
nor in the eloquence of words, but, in the simplicity of the gospel,
and with the demonstration of Divine authority.
He, nevertheless, often found it his place to repress a too eager desire after words,
by setting an example of humble and awful worship in solemn silence.`"

He several times visited many parts of this nation, Scotland and Ireland.
He also visited Friends in America four times:
from the last of these visits he returned "`much reduced in bodily strength;
but he was preserved in much peace, being clothed with innocency and sweetness,
quietly wailing for his change,
and having an evidence that his day`'s work was nearly accomplished.`"
He departed this life the 29th of ninth month, 1780, aged about seventy-one,
a minister forty-seven years.

The following extract of a letter,
written at the time of Thomas Gawthorp`'s last return from America, in 1778,
gives some further particulars of him, and of the situation of affairs in Philadelphia:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

"`William Dillworth brought my brother, Thomas Gawthorp, home in a chaise;
he was very feeble, he can neither write, nor in any way use his right hand.
He says he was twenty-seven days on his passage from Philadelphia to Falmouth;
he was in the former place when Washington and his army were in it,
also after he left it, and William Howe took possession of it without any opposition,
many of the inhabitants rejoicing, though they had little left to give them,
wanting almost everything necessary for the support of the body;
beef and mutton sold at half-a-crown and three shillings per pound,
and other things in proportion.
Before he left the place, four pins sold for a halfpenny,
and Friends wished to have bought him two yards of flannel to put about him at sea,
but could not get it.
He says his son James, who is settled in Virginia, suffered much;
and for refusing to muster when required by the Provincials,
he was taken and marched two hundred miles, to Philadelphia,
with his hands tied behind him and a gun on his back; he was not kept long,
but sent home again, but was not allowed to see his father,
though then in Philadelphia.`"

1778.)

Warrington, Twelfth month 8th, 1756.

A time of deep poverty and leanness,
in which it hath pleased the heavenly Father I should be much exercised since my return,
might plead my excuse were I silent.
But I wish to assure thee of my very near regard, however poor and worthless I am:
and indeed, I think, at times,
I see a wisdom unutterable in the most stripping times which are allotted,
when we sit alone and hold our peace,
for our houses would never be so carefully swept and searched,
if we had the ten pieces of silver in constant possession and view.
I am, however, humbly content; I dare not complain, it is not lawful.
There is a just occasion administered by the inadvertence of the past,
or for the instruction of the future part of life.

It consists with His wisdom, who is perfect in knowledge,
to balance our steps in righteousness; he wisely ascertains the bounds of day and night;
the hilly, rugged path and painful steps, the smooth part also of our race,
are all planned in a knowledge too great for our present comprehension.
Here may we reverently acknowledge our incapacity for choosing right for ourselves,
and commit our all into his hand, as into the hand of a faithful and good preserver.
In the midst of his attributes of glory and majesty,
there is to be read the excellent name of most merciful Father;
but this only when he gives vision to the eye he has formed; until then,
who is so poor and blind as his servant?

May that Hand which hath led and sustained thee hitherto in slippery paths,
from thy youth upwards, for such hath thy pilgrimage led through,
be thy staff during the residue of thy passage;
that by his help thou may offer an evening sacrifice of praise, and say.
Oh!
Lord, thou hast been with me from my youth to this hour.

Our worthy friends, Abraham Farrington and Samuel Emlen, have been at my house a week;
the former has gone to visit a neighbouring county.
I believe he will have great and good service amongst us.
Samuel Emlen is not, at present, fit for much travelling, and is advised to lay by;
I hope for his company at my house this ensuing winter.

I have not been favoured with a line from Pennsylvania since I left it;
I am not distressed about it; may the message have its proper weight,
and I care not if the messenger be forgotten.
I have nevertheless, heard with sorrow of your distress,
and the slaughter on you confines.
I think the clouds are heavy with a storm towards various parts of the British empire;
scarcity of bread threatens us here,
and is already severely felt by the poor in many parts of this land.

At the close of the year 1756, and during the winter,
there was much distress amongst the poor in Warrington, as well as in many other places,
owing to the high price of provisions, and insufficient employment:
the sufferings of his neighbours excited the compassion of Samuel Fothergill,
and he wrote the following address,
in which he adverts also to the circumstance of the town being
then encumbered with a company of itinerant stage players.

The address was published anonymously,
but it effected the removal of those people from the town,
and caused a subscription to be raised for the
relief of the suffering part of the inhabitants.

[.embedded-content-document.paper]

[.letter-heading]
A few Hints addressed to the Inhabitants of Warrington, 1756.

The present distress of our poor neighbours justly demands our attention,
and ought to excite in our minds a proper disposition to relieve them,
accompanied with gratitude to that kind Providence who
hath made us to differ from one another.

Sympathy with the distressed is a painful yet pleasing sensation,
to those who consider the social duties of life necessary to be sustained with propriety,
as one step towards a fellowship hereafter, +++[+++which]
every consideration should induce us to aspire after.

If we are blessed with hearts susceptible of such impressions,
to mitigate their distress will necessarily be our endeavour,
if happily their burden may be made lighter through our assistance.

These remarks arise from the general complaints and cries of our suffering poor,
which indeed are loud and piercing, through the want of bread.
Circumstances the most painful, where not a few parents,
after the labour of the day are compelled to hear, without any possibility of relief,
the piteous cries of their children for bread;
alas I they are not able to procure it for them.

That this is the state of many amongst us, is a most painful, certain truth;
though perhaps, neither thought of, nor attended to by many,
who in fulness of bread and ease, forget the anxiety of the poor.

What attempts have we made to relieve them, and mitigate their sorrow and suffering?
I wish I could give a detail of many:--are the inhabitants
unable to administer relief to their poor neighbours?
are their circumstances such as to render it difficult
for them to sustain the necessary duties of society?
I believe otherwise.

Have we not had amongst us, for many weeks, a gang of players, vagabonds,
declared such by the laws of the land.
Cannot we find money enough to squander upon them, to supply their luxury,
and pay them for corrupting our youth?
We can spare, as I am credibly informed, from eight to fifteen pounds per night,
supporting, at the expense probably of one hundred pounds, these vagabonds,
in defiance of every awful sanction of laws.
Divine and human; and yet hear unmoved the cries, and see the tears,
of our starving poor, who mourn for the relief we thus lavish away.

Is this a loan to the Lord we might hope himself would repay?
Who will hesitate a moment, upon reflection,
whether it be not more consistent with our duty and interest,
to turn this stream of profusion into the families of the poor;
to banish this nuisance from amongst us;
prove ourselves capable of rational and religious considerations;
and thereby will be suggested to us, in a time of need, the calm,
peaceful evidence of our having been good stewards of the manifold mercies of God.

Philadelphia, First month 11th, 1757.

Our yearly meeting at Burlington was a time of great favour to the upright.
Honest Thomas Gawthorp was there, and had some very satisfactory opportunities in public.
In the meeting of ministers, John Churchman told me,
he thought him equal at least to any he had ever heard.
In the meetings for discipline, he was several times singularly favoured;
but it is not often he is permitted thus to ascend: his path is trodden by few,
and he is often reduced so low, both in body and mind,
as to be scarcely able to keep on his feet.

The eye that is still over us for good,
directed through the service of that meeting in a manner not to be forgotten;
it began sooner and lasted longer than usual,
and though many seemed to come prepared for war,
yet the spirit of the Lamb was victorious, that without much argument or controversy,
the mouths of gainsayers were stopped,
and the authority of Truth presided remarkably to the conclusion;
which was a little sooner than would have been chosen,
if the burial of our worthy friend, John Evans,
had not engaged many of us to assent to it.
That good man had a time of close sifting and probation on his death bed;
I went with Daniel Stanton to visit him a few days before he died, and found him low,
dejected, and distressed.
This should excite alarming considerations in some of us,
who are conscious how vastly deficient we are of
the attainments which he had experienced;
yet, alas!
I must confess we lay it too little to heart.

Lancaster, First month 23rd, 1757.

That pure love which I often feel bubbling up towards thee in the spring of Divine life,
engages me to send a few lines beseeching thy acceptance,
as I know we have an endeared affection for each other,
grounded in and upon that ancient Root,
which hath hitherto borne up and been the support of us and of all the faithful,
through the various tribulations of our march.
And lest our grand adversary, under any disguise, should get one step in upon any of us,
to deprive us of that free partaking of the sap, and virtue,
and nourishment which this heavenly root affords,
I have made a narrow search and close examination of myself and inward condition,
with as much singleness and impartiality as I was capable of.
For I was ready to think thou had not such full unity with me, nor indeed with few of us,
as used to be.
I could tell no reason for it,
except that we could not all see and think alike about some new proposals,
and in this we did not play the hypocrite, but spoke freely,
and I believe in much love and friendship.
I am sure I did, for it is the way Truth leads me,
whether I may be the better or worse thought of for so doing;
and after I have spoken my mind, do think myself clear, not bearing any grudge,
or harbouring any ill opinion respecting those who may not at that time see as I do.
But I search my belief over again, whether they or I was in the right;
for we none of us plead infallibility, or desire any should pin their faith upon us,
but desire all may see for themselves, and see right;
so leave such things as cannot at that time be accomplished by love, nor strive too much,
nor over-drive any of the flock, lest thereupon they should sicken and die;
for all are not of one strength, and yet with care, time, and patience,
may so run as to accomplish their journey.
We read, the Apostle Paul was not only strong, but skillful also,
in spreading the Gospel net, becoming weak with the weak,
taking their pace in a gentle manner, whereby he caught many.

I hope it is far remote from my heart`'s intention to
daub any stone in God`'s Zion with untempered mortar,
or to heal any wound of sin deceitfully;
but I find as it was love ever raised and made
any of us instruments of service in the house,
so it is by our abiding under the same influence that the body comes to be edified,
and to grow from one degree of strength to another,
to be changed from one measure of clearness in understanding, brightness and glory,
to another.
And though thou may think our meeting worse than it was a few years since,
I own myself to be of another judgment, both respecting aged and young;
but I may be mistaken, so shall leave it for time and truth to determine,
and with a heart fruitful in love to thee, my beloved and valuable friend,
and thy dear wife, I now conclude, and remain thy real, true, and constant friend,

Warrington, Second month 4th, 1757.

That affectionate regard which Truth itself raised mutually in our hearts,
is by no means impaired.
Often, very often, since I left your land, has it been strongly revived,
and more especially so upon receiving the sorrowful
tidings of the removal of thy dear husband,
a circumstance in which the affliction is, like the loss, very extensively felt.
Thou mournest the loss of a tender husband; his children, that of an affectionate father;
the church laments a pillar removed from the place it filled,
at a time when such are greatly wanted.
A sorrow allowable--for the perfect example of every virtue, even Jesus wept for Lazarus;
this, nature demands, when its connections are broken,
and the endearing social ties dissolved: but thou well knowest,
and I hope it now stands thee in stead, that we are all pilgrims and strangers,
as our fathers were, each journeying on through this region of distress,
towards that city which hath foundations.
Why should we grieve too much when a companion with whom we have travelled many dubious,
anxious steps, has an entrance granted him into the holy city a few moments before us,
and enjoys consummate felicity,
whilst we stand at the door and wait also for the same fruition,
of which at times we receive the earnest?

Upon all the glory of the earth, and all its enjoyments, upon every visible thing,
one inscription is written,
as the immutable law and determination of Him whose name is the Most High;
"`They shall perish.`"
Throughout all nature and natural connections, however endearing,
it has been and must be verified.
Equally fixed is the subsequent truth, the joy and the song of many generations,
"`But thou remainest.`"
On this everlasting Husband, Father, Friend, and Succour may thou and thine now lean,
and know this dispensation sanctified and blessed to all your help,
in renewing diligent care to live and move, that when the Great Shepherd shall appear,
and all his faithful servants with him, your portion may be among them forever.

And now, I cannot avoid addressing myself to you, the descendants of my honoured,
because honourable friend.
I am convinced the same gracious Hand which was his support and comfort,
has been near to some of you for the like glorious purpose,
even to establish you before him forever.
But I am jealous that the want of religious depth, and simplicity God-ward,
hath been cause of halting, and rather a choosing to embrace the present world,
and have a name eminent in it, than to have a new name, the name of God,
and of the city of God.
Thus will the heavenly tenders of immortal treasure be disregarded,
and the vain shadows of things be preferred to those true riches,
which none ever sought with too great diligence, or if they sold them,
ever got their worth in exchange.
A heart honestly concerned for your help cannot contain or dictate flattery;
I love you dearly, therefore thus I write.
I am also persuaded there is a seed and heritage that mourns in secret,
because of its leanness, and honestly seeks relief whence it hath ever sprung.
May stability and patience be the girdle of their loins,
and in the Lord`'s time this poor, suppliant,
distressed seed will delight itself in fatness.

One general hint from my own experience, and the parity of our states,
would I suggest to young people.
Let all your conduct demonstrate that you
remember the worthy deceased with due affection,
and though he be dead with respect to the body, yet let him speak.
I have found it my duty and great advantage to place in view my worthy father,
and in matters of importance, or dubious cases, to consult what would have pleased him,
who was ripe in experience and judgment.
I believe this reverence to the memory of a worthy and religious parent,
is an oblation of sweet incense before the Everlasting Father.

Farewell, dear Ellen; may Israel`'s Rock be thy safe abode, and keep thee fresh in spirit,
green and fruitful in old age, and unite thee to Him,
and the many generations of the just, who are entered within the pearl gates.

Farewell, ye descendants of the great and good; imitate their example;
as they followed Jesus Christ, follow ye them.
Be wise, for it is true happiness: in wisdom you will fear to offend,
and this fear is an excellent defence.

Warrington, Second month 4th, 1757.

As the love I bear thee is sincere, I flatter myself it is reciprocal.
I know thy engagements are various,
I also know my own unworthiness to engross time which may be spent more usefully.

I think I am profited by the general silence of my acquaintance on your side the water;
it has led to a solemn, strict scrutiny and review.
Perhaps I might have acted more wisely in some parts of my conduct;
but if integrity of heart and honesty of intention are general salt,
I appeal to the Searcher of hearts,
every part of my labour amongst you was seasoned thereby.
I have been, since my return, making some proficiency in the holy school.
I left your land with a holy quiet, and knew upon my return the royal diadem upon me.
I have known the withdrawing of the pure river,
which is the cause of solid joy to those who are replenished by it.
I have seldom in the course of my experience known so dipping a time.
The day again hath dawned, in which the mysteries couched in darkness,
and sealed for a time, are opened, as well as the requisite labour of the day;
that I find when the cloud is taken off the tabernacle,
the voice is very near to call to fresh labour; and methinks,
in a humbling sense of the worthiness of our Master to be ever served,
all within me says, O Lord, give me thy presence, in which is all things,
and let prompt obedience be my return forever!
Oh that it might also be thy happy lot to know the feast of dedication,
for in the solemn day of dedication of the temple to God, a glorious feast is ever held.
I am abundantly convinced the Author of all sure mercies would have it so;
and if Solomon`'s choice of wisdom be thine, He will array thee with distinguished glory;
if otherwise, the event is fixed.
He will cast off and reject.

It is time to conclude,
which I cannot well without a testimony of affectionate
remembrance of thy wife and children,
for whose true help and establishment in the best things I am concerned,
even with a distinguished anxiety.
May you, their parents, by living example, show them the way to rest and peace,
and thereby a peaceful acquittance in the day of inquisition will be obtained,
and I trust the solid satisfaction of seeing in this life
those fruits of Heaven`'s blessing on your zeal and care,
which may be yours, and your children`'s everlasting rejoicing.

Remember, I entreat you, dear children, and humbly seek Him in youth,
for religion and holy fear is the best embellishment of youth,
and the safe and only guide through the difficulties and snares of life,
as well as the excellent companion and solace of declining years.

Philadelphia, Second month 19th, 1757.

On the 8th instant I received thy very affectionate epistle.
The kind expressions of regard and good wishes for my welfare which it contains,
affected my mind with a degree of reverent thankfulness,
and with a desire that my attention and solicitude
might increase steadily to pursue the path of peace,
whether it is joyous or afflicting; for I have felt, and with awful weight,
the danger of missing the crown; and lately my situation was dismal,
and thus continued a long time, so that I was entirely without hope,
yet subscribed to the Almighty`'s justice.
And though the prospect of an eternal separation,
and an inheritance of inexpressible misery, was beyond utterance distressing,
yet I was filled with deep anxiety for the tender youth
whose feet might be turned out of the path,
or greatly injured in their journey, if by being left to myself,
I should commit any thing that might bring a reproach.
And though prayer was cut off,
yet was I resolved I would live as near to that which I thought right,
as weak reason would suggest, or was in my power.
At length the long suffering and gracious Being
was pleased to favour with a degree of light,
in a time unexpected, and a prospect of duty seemed to open,
to which I seemed freely resigned, but afterwards that vanished, and I enjoyed a calm,
and was willing to do, or to suffer any thing to be under the Divine notice.

May my spirit reverently magnify the Lord, and rejoice with fear in the all-merciful God,
whose tender dealing with us cannot be fully set forth.
The freedom with which thou hast written to me,
and the fatherly care manifested when present, have made me thus free,
believing thou wast not altogether insensible of my situation,
and the danger that attended me when thou wrote,
for many of thy expressions were applicable;
for too great inattention has been my failing, and indeed I am surrounded with infirmity,
and darkness often covers me.

Warrington, Second month 25th, 1757.

The ground of that pure and true friendship, which subsisted betwixt our worthy fathers,
was doubtless in that love which remains throughout all generations;
and as the natural descendants from fellow members so united,
abide in the same love and pure friendship with the ever-living Head,
the union will remain undiminished, and the present, as well as the past,
will make us as epistles in one another`'s hearts.

Two expressions have often, since we parted, moved in my mind to apply to thee,
with earnest desires they may have due place.
The first is this:--Know thy place.
I am made fully sensible the Lord of the family hath designed one for thee, in his house,
to bear up the ark in these times, when it is grievously shaken.
For this end hath he vouchsafed the visitation of life and understanding,
and hath at times taught thee to travail in spirit for the cause,
and admitted thee to the tribulation of the companions of Jesus;
a fellowship not eligible to many, who would have the cause to prosper,
but do not concur in the promotion of it, in themselves or others.
Let not the embarrassments of this world, neither the commerce of it,
nor its stupifying fears and turbulent commotions,
divert from an honest inquiry after thy proper place in the church.
There is all our safety and rest.
In stormy times, these know, such is the excellency of Zion`'s dwelling place,
none can make her afraid.
A stone in a building is not serviceable merely for its filling a vacancy, but,
being skillfully placed, it keeps others also in theirs; it covers some,
and supports others;
that the share every stone has in the support of
an edifice is worthy of religious application.
An humble application to the holy Workman to square and fit,
and a sincere yet fervent resignation to be placed where He will, will, in his own time,
fully instruct what is our place, and fix us therein.
Having known thy place, and entered therein,
abide there--was the other hint which spread in my heart towards thee.
Beware of being turned out of it by any of those
suggestions which an unwearied enemy frequently raises.
One seemingly plausible is the want of proper qualification; but whence this want?
Is it of the Lord of perfection that the people are lame and defective, or of themselves?
He is infinitely full of all we want, and would make our feet firm upon the mountains,
and therein beautiful.
Beware of arraigning a wisdom that is deep and high; yea,
unfathomably so in the building of his house,
and the choice of the several parts thereof;
for where this spirit prevails that puts off labour,
and slides away with the plea of unfitness,
it hastens their rejection from the house of God; and alas I then,
what fabric can they flee to, in the stormy day of his power and wrath?

Inwardly dwell in His pure preserving fear.
Let not the world lift up above thy proper place,
in reverence of heart and chastity towards the Beloved:
let not the extensive concerns of merchandise, lawful in themselves,
be carried to such a degree, as to induce to forget the pearl hid in the field;
and I humbly hope thou wilt attain and retain that rest which is steadfast and immovable,
rejoice thyself,
and teach others also how to rejoice in the stability of God`'s salvation.

Farewell, dear friend;
may the most substantial of all blessings be diligently enough sought,
and it will be found, and be an excellent defence.

In the spring of the year 1757, Samuel Fothergill had an alarming illness,
which lasted a considerable time.
The exertion and fatigue he had undergone in America;
the long journeys on horseback which he was in the constant habit of performing;
the nature of his public services,
and the many engagements which incessantly occupied his mind,
ail combined to produce a serious effect upon his constitution,
from which it never afterwards fully recovered.

His strength was on this occasion greatly reduced, and his recovery was slow.
It is thus mentioned in the journal of his intimate friend, Catharine Payton:--

"`Fourth month 9th, 1757.--We went to Warrington,
where a renewed occasion of thankfulness to gracious Providence was administered,
by the probability of the recovery of our dear friend Samuel Fothergill,
from an indisposition wherein his life had been despaired of.
This had much affected my mind,
from the consideration of the great loss the church would sustain by his removal,
and myself as an individual member thereof; yet durst I not ask his longer continuance,
in this state of trials and dangers,
knowing that if Divine wisdom called him out of it now,
it would certainly be in the best time.`"

Newtown, near Carlisle, Third month 19th, 1757.

Yesterday I was at Carlisle monthly meeting; it was large.
I had been very weak for several days, but was helped much that day;
the helping hand was near.
I have often found it has been the way in which I have been led deep into suffering,
both in body and in mind, to be prepared to do a good or great work; and after it,
must be brought down again, almost, as it seems, near to death.
Oh!
Astonishing! why must it so be, or so suffered?
but to keep the creature from glorying; and to prepare it for another work,
it must be marred.
O, let it be in the Potter`'s hand, new made for every work.
Had I been a silver or a golden vessel, the marvel need not have been so great.
Silver or gold will melt easily, and not lose either virtue or weight;
but wooden vessels cannot bear the fire, but deep scouring, rubbing,
and scalding they must have, to take out the scent they are apt to contract.
So that I find that saying remains true, and will stand forever,
"`Every branch in me that beareth fruit, my heavenly Father purgeth it,
that it may bring forth more fruit;`" and again,
"`whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,`" and those who are without it, or do not love it,
are bastards.
O, what need we have of patience, after we have done the will of our Master,
to wait for the promise.
New whetting, new grinding, new melting, seems to be, I think,
the lot of poor instruments and vessels, for the work is new; but who are we,
that we should reply, or ask the question, Why hast thou made me thus,
subject to change or be changed?
It may be, if we can be enough passive, and content, from being marred in our own eyes,
the change may be from glory to glory.

What am I writing, or to whom?
If I have gone too far, do not expose me.

Yesterday I received an agreeable account from cousin Charles Chorley of thy recovery.
As soon as thy strength, the weather, and the roads permit,
the easy motion of a carriage will, perhaps, be beneficial: be very careful, however,
of the first cold, for this may plunge thee again into great difficulties.

This, I hope, will find thee fast recruiting, and if not yet able to write thyself,
yet let us hear from thee through some channel, as often as possible.
I must leave to our sister, for a while,
the management of a correspondence which is one of the principal pleasures I enjoy.
But I am almost oppressed at present, though, I trust,
it will not be of long continuance;
and I write this after having mounted not less than fifty single pairs of stairs today,
and some of them at no small distance from each other; but whilst I have any sense left,
whether I am able to express it or not, I shall always remain thy affectionate brother,

Dudley, Fourth month 4th, 1757.

B+++.+++ M. and myself were favoured to get well to Stafford,
the next evening after setting out on the journey.
The next day was extremely wet, and perhaps,
proved a sufficient excuse to some of our brethren in profession,
for their not attending the monthly and quarterly meetings, both held there.
The number of those who came was very small: I think not above a dozen or fourteen men,
and not more women; among the latter was dear Catharine Payton, to whom, I believe,
it was a day of suffering and pain.
She intimated her willingness to see some of their families at home,
and much to my unexpected pleasure,
intimated a freedom that I might accompany her therein.

I thought a little of the matter, and hoped, if I proved not in her way, or burdensome,
it might be an additional opportunity of improvement to myself,
among the many put into my hands by a gracious God,
whose long-continued willingness for my help furnishes
matter of humble admiration and thankfulness,
with a degree of which I wish my mind may be daily clothed;
being satisfied I am distinguished by receiving many mercies,
and peculiar marks of unmerited long neglected favours.
O that the time past, in which my heart has been too much attached to lying vanities,
may be properly, and then will it be profitably, reflected upon,
by quickening to greater care and vigilance in the important work of true religion,
the necessity of which, at times, is in mercy shown me.

I am painfully sensible, that although I was, early after my coming to Warrington,
called upon in your meeting, in the words of the apostle, "`O, Timothy,
keep that which is committed to thy trust,
avoiding profane and vain babblings;`" an inattention
to the former hath been an inlet to the latter,
and to my unwary mind, hath been a destructive snare of the adversary, who, alas,
persuades too many of the unguarded youth,
that if they refrain from those things accounted among men immoral,
they are then safe from noxious things.
By this specious delusion, my sorrowful experience bears me witness,
a seeking after that most desirable knowledge,
of a growth in spiritual understanding and Divine favour, is diverted.
Hence come leanness and poverty, which if not timely fled from, produce death;
against which I desire to be more watchful than in the former part of my time, and hope,
when it is well with thee, for thy future breathings on my behalf, to that Being,
with whom is all-sufficiency.

The sorrowful news from Ireland of the church`'s loss,
and the afflicting dispensation allotted to S. Neale,
in the death of my dear mother in the Truth, Mary Peisley, quickly spread thus far;
an additional evidence of the uncertain continuance of all sublunary things,
which I wish may awaken me to more strict consideration thereof,
and diligence to endeavour, as much as in me lies,
to follow the footsteps of that truly worthy woman, of whom I have this testimony,
that of all the people within the compass of my knowledge,
I think none were more watchfully circumspect at all times than she.
Though now gone from works to rewards,
I hope the remembrance of her will be often
livingly fresh in my mind for my own instruction.
The endearing love which subsisted between her and dear Catharine Payton,
will render the trial to the latter great;
she knows where in time past she has found support,
and I hope will be yet enabled to trust in Him, who remains to the upright,
unalterably faithful and all-sufficient.

My good wishes are towards thy brother Joseph`'s family,
to some of whom the visitation of Divine love is extended,
to the humbling of their minds at times; may they prize the mercy while afforded.
The contrition under which I have sometimes seen Sarah^
footnote:[The second daughter of Joseph Fothergill, afterwards Sarah Hird.
She died at Leeds, third month 31st, 1819, aged seventy-eight.]
has affected my mind, and raised desires that she may now, in the time of youth,
the most acceptable season, be prevailed with to embrace that,
which will furnish true peace and durable comfort,
when the most pleasing of temporal enjoyments sink into very nothingness,
with respect to any satisfaction in their power to yield.

Warrington, Fourth month 25th, 1757.

I have had a long indisposition, being afflicted with the rheumatism and a fever,
and in general apprehension near my final change; but am, through mercy,
much better in my health, though very weak, and have but at times the use of my hand.

Neither absence, nor sickness, nor any other circumstance,
hath impaired that love unfeigned, I bear to thee, thy dear wife and children;
a love flowing from a pure fountain,
which would effectually wash all our garments from everything unlovely,
if we enough sought and waited for its baptizing virtue,
and would present us without spot or wrinkle to our holy Head.

I have found it very necessary to bow in heart to the rod with
which the Heavenly Father has pleased to chastise me,
and with inward and outward distress to humble into very dust before him.
A time of profitable searching, I trust, I have had; and may it evermore remain,
and its result as a nail fastened in a sure place.
We serve a wise, gracious Master, and yet, even after we have done our duty,
and laboured according to the present direction and portion of strength,
we have need of patience,
for in the inscrutable treasure-house of our Master is reserved our wages.
Oh that such may be our fidelity, through the various revolutions of our pilgrimage,
that nothing may deprive us of our crown;
but having received the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
may we hold it fast without wavering, and receive its reward,
even the salvation of our souls.

Our worthy friend Abraham Farrington, was lately well in the county of Durham.
He has along with him the most unquestionable seals to his commission,
and is amongst us in the fulness of the gospel
power to search out the hidden things of Esau,
and is a nursing father to the tender plants.

I am greatly obliged to thee for the extracts of the proceedings of your yearly meeting,
and glad to hear you were favoured with the overshadowing of the Holy Wing in it,
and blessed with a spirit of mutual condescension.
I hope all things will work together for good, as the meek,
suffering nature of the Lamb is abode in.

I was supported by the Hand which has been often near to my help,
to labour honestly in London, and not ashamed of the gospel of Christ my Lord.
Many of the warmest opposers of the progress of the church from strength to strength,
were at their country houses.
I expect the united attack of such will be upon me at the yearly meeting.
But I know who has covered my head hitherto,
and I humbly beg for wisdom and counsel and strength in the field of battle,
in which I shall find myself necessarily engaged.

Dear worthy Mary Peisley is now beyond the reach of reproach,
having suddenly finished her course, and gone down to the grave,
in the highest degree of splendour, and the glory of her Master`'s countenance,
which was most eminently, nay, in a double portion,
with her for some weeks before her final change.
She was married to Samuel Neale the 17th, taken ill two days afterwards,
and departed the 20th of last month,
to the great loss of the poor withering church in Ireland.
But unsearchable is the wisdom, and perfect the goodness of God,
who rules in heaven and on earth.

I cannot make retaliation of the favours and kindness I
have received from thee and thy family.
My most ardent wishes are for all your prosperity,
and growth up into heavenly places in Christ our holy head;
that the blessings of heaven and its fruitful
dew may be known to lie upon your many branches,
yea, to remain there long; that even beyond your excellent progenitors,
your blessings may extend;
and thus would Eternal Fulness plenteously diffuse more and
more through the families of his people the riches of all ages,
as they are made the chiefest joy.

Thine I received this day, and have to acknowledge,
with gratitude to the gracious Preserver of men,
I am much recovered from my late indisposition, though yet weak,
and not altogether free from pain.

I nevertheless hope to reach the yearly meeting in London,
and am necessarily obliged to make it as easy a journey as I can.
I hope to be at Coventry the day thou mentions,
and have thought of easing myself now and then by the use of a post chaise.
I am under some engagement of mind to attend a meeting
in this neighbourhood next first-day but one,
and am really unfit to make any excursions out of the direct road,
unless duty absolutely required.

With the utmost sincerity, I wish thy daughter Hannah much happiness.
May Jesus be called to her marriage, and every real blessing be extended,
in the wise proportions of eternal mercy and wisdom.
Let not the transient glare of this world nor its fallacious promises,
bring a veil over that beauty which is in holiness,
or impair in her view the loveliness of that one in a thousand,
"`fairer than the children of men,`" whom she has sometimes beheld in measure.
All visibles are fleeting; all lower connections, however tender, endearing, and laudable,
liable to dissolution;
but he that loved us and gave himself for us remains the Ancient of Days,
yet new every morning.
Let your example, oh parents! impress these truths deeply on your offspring,
and spread amongst those with whom you have to do, or amongst whom you have to walk,
lively examples of that humility and heavenly mindedness which becomes and adorns those,
who well knowing the greatness of this world is a tempting snare,
and yet an empty bubble, seek a city which hath foundations,
laid and established before the foundation of the world was laid.
Farewell, beloved friends, be wise, watchful and happy.

When I last parted from thee at Gravesend, I could not think, if we both lived,
that I should have missed seeing thee at the
first yearly meeting in London after thy return,
which I much longed for.
I am unavoidably prevented, and so must submit;
I have not missed above once before for twenty-three years.
I am very glad and thankful it has pleased Providence to permit thy safe return,
and to hear that thy health is restored;
for I am ready to believe there was never more need of a nearness one to another;
nor any period, that, in my remembrance, called for more circumspection.
We seem, from many incidents fallen out, more noticed than ever,
and according to the shining of our lights shall we become a
blessing or a hindrance to those that are seeking truth.
I can truly say I greatly wish in our whole conduct that we may be blameless and harmless.

In this place we have of late had great changes, and Truth has, in particulars,
operated very strongly, I may safely add miraculously; the freethinker, the libertine,
the scoffer, having in great nothingness and humility,
been deeply baptized into the spirit of the gospel, so that the last are become first,
and some that have been cause of great pain are now a cause of joy.
I am sure I am truly glad that it is so, yet I cannot help also desiring,
that such as by their outward appearance have seemed first,
may not be the very hindermost, or that, being centred in form and ease,
they should become lost to the very savour of life, and so be dry and die.
May all be incited to more and more diligence,
by seeing the invitation of our great Lord
embraced by such as have long dwelt in unbelief,
and have, as it were, wasted their substance in a strange land.

I know not what I shall urge for my writing thee thus,
but I found a desire to salute thee in a few lines.
Thy affectionate friend,

In that love which neither time nor distance can efface--which
breathes health and salvation to all,
and especially to the heritage of God--do I salute thee,
with ardent desires for thy preservation and yet
firmer establishment on the eternal Rock,
which I am sure I find it necessary daily to press after,
and believe it to be so for all, however advanced in experience,
or dignified with divine honour, who are yet in a state of progression,
and may advance in glory and holy stability.
And inasmuch as we may acknowledge, with humble gratitude,
that the Lord our God has done much for us,
and in his own wisdom and power exalted us above many of his servants,
may we be still concerned that his own image, which is purity and perfection,
may be more and more conspicuous in all our works;
that we may be examples to the believers, in word, in conversation, in doctrine,
in spirit, in faith, in purity.

Through infinite favour, I am got thus far, I hope well, on my journey,
having been helped by the mighty Helper to discharge my
duty beyond my expectation or desert;
and also made subject to the humbling dispensations of his providence,
so that it has been little to me whether I was clothed with the royal robe,
or made to appear naked and barefoot in the view of the people,
if the name of my God might but be honoured in and by me;
both which states have been remarkably my lot, and I believe, will be measurably so,
of all the vessels that are made and preserved honourable in the Lord`'s house.
They must be stripped of themselves, and have all former experience taken away;
so shall their ministry be more and more refined,
and effectual to the end for which it is appointed; and though it appear less in measure,
it will be more in weight.
It is not, my dear friend, because thou art ignorant of these things, that I write them,
but as they freely offer to my pen, I drop them simply:
perhaps by such free communication we may read each other in the life,
and be incited to persevere in the heavenly race.

I am favoured with an agreeable companion in Sophia Hume,
and John Kendall has given up to accompany us in our intended journey to Holland,
who I rather hope will be more serviceable than some Friends may expect,
as he has of late years been industriously improving himself in the language:
so far as I can yet discover, Providence smiles on the undertaking,
and I humbly hope will favour us with peace therein.

I marvel not at the low, stripping seasons thou hast experienced,
since thy return from such an engagement; and indeed,
it is a manifest token of the peculiar regard of Infinite Wisdom and mercy,
to administer a balance of this sort to his children,
who are indulged with large attainments, and blessed with precious endowments,
that through every dispensation of his providence they may be preserved in
an humble dependence upon the strength of His everlasting arm,
whose faithfulness faileth not.

It was, dear friend, with a considerable degree of concern we heard of thy late illness;
and I think, I may say for all thy friends,
that I do believe there never was a friend amongst us
remembered with a greater degree of esteem,
or more unfeigned love, than thyself.

The aspect of our affairs appears more and more gloomy,
and the Lord alone knows what will be the event of these commotions in the earth;
in the midst of which, all that the humble have to hope for is,
that they may see Jerusalem a quiet habitation,
a tabernacle that shall not be trodden down.
He is sufficient to exalt his own name and power,
by ways and means which are not to be comprehended by the finite,
limited comprehensions of men, though the clouds are darkened by an impending storm.

Daniel Stanton desires to be particularly remembered to thee;
thy letter to him was particularly acceptable and very serviceable,
as it came in a needful time,
and was expressive of that sympathy and regard
which is truly an emanation of the Divine mind,
and which that alone can inspire the soul with;
it could not have been more suitably adapted had thou known his circumstances,
he being then very low in mind.

In the sixth month, 1757, Samuel Fothergill attended the quarterly meeting at York,
and the following circumstance is related of him.
He had been largely engaged in the ministry,
and was at that time in great repute among Friends everywhere;
his company was much sought,
and many appeared to strive who should show him most attention.
He was earnestly pressed to stay and attend the meetings on the ensuing first-day.
An aged woman, from the country, a plain, honest Friend,
believing him to be in some danger from the caresses of the people, took him aside,
and repeated the passage,
When Jesus perceived that the people would take him by force and make him a king,
he departed into the mountain himself alone.
Samuel Fothergill saw the force and wisdom of the advice; he took his horse,
and quietly departed towards home; and when afterwards adverting to the circumstance,
he always spoke of it as an excellent admonition.

Norwich, Seventh month 6th, 1757.

I cannot quite easily leave the nation,
without acknowledging the receipt of thy truly
acceptable and seasonable salutation in this city,
wherein I have indeed been partaker of the suffering of the righteous seed,
which I fear is oppressed in the hearts of most of the professors of Truth.
Our meetings are much frequented by many people of other societies,
who have an ear open to the testimony of Truth,
and some are convinced and settled amongst Friends, for divers of whom I hope well; but,
alas! the numerous company of preachers is far from administering joy to me.
I am afraid many of them are untimely births, and some bastards; and these, perhaps,
make the greatest noise, and are in danger of hurting the few true born children,
whose judgment has not yet acquired strength to distinguish
from whence the voices which are uttered are;
and seeing how some, who, I doubt, have little root in experience,
appear great in the branches of doctrine, they may,
on considering how little and foolish they appear,
be discouraged from coming up in their services, or unwarily led to an imitation of that,
which, to a discerning eye, is apparently some of the wares of mystery Babylon.

I am now nearly clear of them,
and hope I may say I have in a good degree discharged myself faithfully; for which,
perhaps, I may not go uncensured;
for I believe it appears somewhat strange and ungrateful to hear one cry,
"`A sword!`" in opposition to such as have cried, "`Peace!`"
But (or I am mistaken,) there is occasion for such doctrine,
even to the chiefs amongst them, some of whom, I fear,
are too much clothed with spiritual pride.

I delivered thy message of love to +++_______+++, but not fully in thy own terms.
I make no doubt of his having been of honourable descent,
and of considerable service in the church; but if I feel aright,
a renewed baptism is necessary for him.
I should scarcely write thus,
did I not fear that the knowledge of his standing in
the relation with thee which thou expresses,
would rather tend to exalt than humble him.
I lodge at Henry Gurney`'s; I feel a considerable nearness of spirit to him,
and to Edmund and his mother.

Although suffering is my lot, my good Master deals bountifully with me,
in resigning my spirit to the various dispensations of his providence,
and sometimes raising me, in his own power, to testify to his eternal Truth.

Oh! my dear friend, may I never forsake the way of his commandments,
in which there is light, peace, and joy unspeakable.
I can say truly, that I fear nothing so much as being debilitated for his service,
by taking any crooked step through life.
Let what will in the course of his unerring providence attend me,
I am at present resigned thereto,
if happily the mark of preservation may but be set upon me.
It is true, as thou observest, "`the conflicts of the passage are arduous.`"
I need thy prayers, not only in the present weighty engagement,
but perhaps more so in my future trials, and through mercy,
I feel thou canst not withhold them,
for the Lord has opened our hearts in intercession one for another,
having singularly united us in the best relationship;
may our eyes be kept attentive to that which alone can make us helpful to each other,
and give an impartial judgment of our prospects and services.

Divine wisdom and mercy has already clothed thee,
pardon me if I say, I rejoice in thy tribulation, as I have frequently done in my own.
I heartily join thee in desiring that I may be preserved humble,
and hope that He who knows best how to proportion the depths to the heights,
for the salvation of his people, will administer baptisms effectual for that end.
The secret strippings and fears which I pass through, are only known to him;

I hope they have had some reason not to repent their visit to this place.
Our meetings have been very large;
probably Catharine Payton may have given thee her sentiments of them, and therefore,
I shall only say,
her appearances therein have been like such as seek not their own honour,
but the glory of Him who hath called them,
and I wish (not without faith,) that they may have
their effect to stir up the negligent to diligence,
and encourage those who have begun in the heavenly race, to persevere,
without fainting to the end, where the prize of eternal life is to be obtained.

A+++.+++ Farrington and his companion leave us this afternoon.
The poor old man is sadly afflicted with pain in his head,
and at times seems very low in his mind,
lest he should thereby be rendered incapable of service.
I accompanied him to two meetings this week,
in both of which he bore powerful testimonies to Truth,
I am persuaded to the edification of most present,
in a manner much suited to their circumstances, and will not soon be forgotten.

There is great need in this country of such skillful and laborious workmen, where,
though there appears some greenness and life, the enemy is scattering his tares,
and in many, yea, abundantly too many, the seed is choked,
and in danger of being destroyed.
How glad would some be to hear thou had drawings in thy mind to pay us a visit;
but if that is not to be expected, yet let us be in thy remembrance,
and when thou art favoured in the secret of thy
heart to approach the throne of Divine Grace,
intercede for our preservation, that we may hold fast the Truth,
of which we are convinced, without wavering, and if it be the will of Providence,
by example, and as He may otherwise appoint, contribute to promote his glory.

Warrington, Seventh month 25th, 1757.

True friendship, like its synonymous virtue, charity,
is not restricted to the general forms of correspondence, but,
whenever its sacred warmth is felt, discovers itself, though perhaps in weak productions.
This, at present, is my apology to thee for writing.

I hope it is well with thee, though, if I judge right,
in a situation rather painful than joyous: but I rejoice in thy tribulation,
as it most certainly tends to produce experience to thyself,
and a yet further establishment in that holy stability,
which is the blessed fruit of suffering, when rightly digested.

Such are the times as to require the true sons of the immortal
Father to enter into their chambers of mourning,
and weep for themselves and Jerusalem`'s progeny; and even to adopt the prophet`'s wish,
"`Oh that my head were waters;`" nevertheless, He, whose is the cause, the kingdom,
the power, and the glory, is not unmindful of his distressed servants nay,
their sorrowful bemoanings are to him a very acceptable sacrifice;
and a Divine fragrance attends them,
as a part of that sweet odour which ever arises to perfume his holy habitation.
Let not, therefore, thy disconsolate situation, in weakness,
and in great poverty at times, dismay thee; neither lose thy hold, in humble,
depending patience,
for that love which is symbolically set forth as
a woman to her sucking child is towards thee,
and as thou abides in its holy relish, and lives in obedience to its holy dictates,
thy borders, though now scarcely visible, will be laid with fair stones; thy windows,
or the faculties of thy spiritual understanding, with agates, well polished or squared,
according to the rules of unerring rectitude; and all thy gates,
through which the will passes into action, of transparent carbuncles;
all fitly framed together, as a receptacle for Him,
who is glorious throughout all his name.
Thus would the Holy One build thee up to his praise; and if he be the architect,
no matter whether we are a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,
or built up in the similitude of a palace; for both are necessary,
in the appendage of the King of kings.

Repine not, therefore, dear friend, at the wise allotment of the great Master to thee,
in the economy of the Holy household; infinitely wise is he who hath assigned it,
and the future reward is proportioned rather to the fidelity of his servants,
than to the sphere of their motion in dignity.

I sympathise with the afflicted from experience, yea, from my present lot,
which is cast by the fountain of Marah.
I may, perhaps, be preparing for some future service, but am, at present,
as I believe is requisite for me, stripped of all.
Some glimmerings of the Master`'s countenance at times appear,
but in the general situation of my mind,
I feel less than the least of all true disciples.
May the name of my God be exalted, though I am abased in dust and ashes.

Amsterdam, Eighth month 1st, 1757.

We arrived at Helvoetsluys on the 22nd ult.,
and proceeded by way of Rotterdam to this city,
where we found a few under the profession of Truth, some of whom I hope and believe,
are measurably in the possession thereof,
although in some particulars not so strict as some Friends in England.
By these we are gladly received, and also by some seeking people of other societies,
especially amongst the Mennonists,
who are a people greatly degenerated from that
simplicity which in the beginning appeared amongst them.
Yet there remains a remnant, who are near the kingdom of Christ, and who,
I cannot help thinking, were there a solid body of Friends in this city,
might be likely to settle with us.
I find myself considerably straitened in conveying the
mind of Truth to the people through an interpreter.

John Vanderwerf acts in that capacity; he is the most suitable person we could meet with,
having a pretty thorough understanding of the English and Dutch tongues,
and being of a sober conversation, and not void of religious impressions.
I believe he is very just in rendering the sense of what I say to the people,
but for want of a greater depth in experience, the virtue seems to me to be in part lost,
and the openings of Truth are choked.
But notwithstanding this discouraging circumstance,
to which I may add my being frequently stripped
of the sensible enjoyment of the best good,
and made to sit in bondage, under the humbling sense of human infirmities,
which creates fears respecting my future standing;
yet have I never been suffered to doubt my coming here
was in the direction of Infinite Wisdom,
who can, if he pleases, make effectual to his glory,
means which to us appear very weak and imperfect.
I am convinced that those who go on such errands as this,
must be divested of seeking great things to themselves,
and endeavour to keep in the patience of Jesus, which, if I am favoured to do, I hope,
at least, to return with the evidence of having done what I could.
I am not without apprehensions that this country has suffered
much for want of being visited by weighty ministers:
and indeed, I have often wondered that any part of the Lord`'s vineyard,
wherein there are any plants of the true vine remaining, should be so much neglected;
or that a country wherein liberty of conscience is allowed,
and wherein some of the people are inquiring after truth,
should have been no more visited of late years.

Doubtless the difficulty I labour under has been a discouragement;
but I cannot help thinking that had the visits of Friends been more frequent,
that difficulty would have been less than it is.

Swansea, Eighth month 1st, 1757.

Thy acceptable letter furnished additional occasion of
reverent thankfulness to thy God and Father,
who, at times,
brings to thy remembrance an object indeed unworthy the notice of his children,
and in great kindness, through them, at times, as well as by his own delectable presence,
lets me know his gracious willingness for my help is not wholly withdrawn;
notwithstanding the repealed backslidings, and departure of heart,
which have been my sorrowful experience, would long ago,
if his ways were like the ways of men,
or his thoughts as the thoughts of the work of his hands,
have caused a total withholding of benefits,
and prevented any further offers of love so often disregarded.

I was yesterday at their meetings here, in both of which, an entire silence,
as to the outward, was kept;
and oh that I could have been more sensible of a
joint inward labour and travail of spirit,
for that sustenance which rightly nourisheth the soul, and preserves it vigorous, quick,
and lively before God.
But alas! poverty, weakness and want are such,
as perhaps to bring so near death`'s door as to be scarcely sensible, sometimes,
when good is stirring in meetings; though at other seasons, when quite alone,
and separate from all outward company, the Lord of mercy, in melting goodness,
graciously vouchsafes some touches of his love; and then doth my heart rejoice,
and with humble gladness, concludes it is good for me to be here.
Be it in whatsoever place it may,
to feel the renewings of heavenly favour is really more
worthy my anxious seeking than all visible things,
some of which have been very desirable in my esteem, and with great solicitude cared for,
at the expense of neglecting the invaluably precious, immortal part.

As the secrets of the Lord still continue to be with them that fear him,
distance of place has not deprived thee of a sense of my condition,
but the holy and all-knowing Intelligence,
who hath heretofore communicated to thee a knowledge of the states of others, did,
in mercy to me, again speak through thee unto me;
and thy letters furnish some encouragement to endeavour
after contentment in the Divine allotment,
and faithful patience in his dealings with me;
though for some weeks past the general situation of my
mind hath been one of great distress and pain.
A solitary path as to the outward, have I had to pass along,
but my heart craves the guidance and direction of that wisdom which is infinite,
and that power all-sufficient may attend.
Under these feelings do I, at times,
hope for stability and advancement in the too little
frequented path of the tribulated followers of Jesus.

I am thankful for thy kind notice of me, and so long as I retain my right senses,
shall be glad of its continuance; and by seeing some testimonials of it,
either in very few or many lines,
just as thou findest thy mind qualified by that Power which
hath often made thee an instrument of good to others,
to his own glory and to thy peace.
That his arm may keep thee in hours of difficulty and deep distress,
on account of those who are unmindful of their true and chief good, is my great desire.

I am, through mercy, restored to a tolerable degree of health,
though not so fully confirmed as I could wish;
but I desire patiently to acquiesce with the allotment of Providence,
with the consciousness,
that I have spent my strength and constitution in the best of causes,
and I leave the event to Him who is infinitely wise.

I remember every branch of thy family with a peculiar tenderness;
and not seldom I visit you in spirit, with a portion of that warmth I found when present,
and which is not lost or extinguished by personal absence.

Worthy Thomas Brown, I hear,
is removed to the full and everlasting fruition of that society
amongst whom he happily conversed in his pilgrimage below,
to abide with everlasting burnings in seraphic love,
where he lighted his fire when he sacrificed before the congregation.
Oh happy, desirable release from care and pain, to freedom and eternal certainty!
The chilling winds of this world`'s care can no more obstruct his verdure and fragrancy,
but, planted on the banks of the river of life,
his leaves and fruits will be ever produced,
through all the duration of the everlasting year.

Excuse my incoherent letter; it is a copy of the present state of my mind,
engaged in various and almost oppressive labour,
yet at all times replenished with love to my friends,
and amongst that number is very distinguishedly every branch of your family.

Warrington, Ninth month, 1757.

I salute thee and thine in true love.
I have often felt it strong,
and still perceive it is of that nature many waters cannot quench,
nor can the distance of place impair it.
And it is a most singular privilege the true
born children enjoy in their mutual sense of,
and access to, the table of good things,
when the laws of matter and motion deprive them of personal intercourse.
Oh that we may know the renewings of the Holy Ghost upon us,
in such a manner as to qualify for a place in the Lord`'s house, and therein to abide,
as sanctified vessels, empty or full, as his wisdom sees meet.
My lot hath been often among the empty vessels,
in which allotment I wish a wise resignation,
to guard me against impatience and insensibility.
I have had several letters from my friends on your side of the water,
which give me an account of things amongst you.
I hope the trials permitted to attend you will tend to the help of many,
though I believe them very severe and pinching.
The desolations on your frontiers are very distressing,
but the difference in Friends`' judgment, the disunion within the gates of our Zion,
affords more cause of mourning.
I am glad to hear mutual condescension prevails amongst you,
that ancient signal of best fellowship.

I nearly sympathize with the living amongst you in this time of deep probation.
O, that you may all stand fast, and quit yourselves like men,
for that testimony and faith once delivered, and now revived, to the saints.
In this heavenly brotherhood I feel myself in spirit present with you in your land;
not as having left aught undone which duty required,
but in the sweet participation of the hope, patience,
and tribulation of the Gospel and kingdom of Jesus our Lord.
And if the church go into the wilderness, her place is prepared of God,
whose eye looks towards, and his arm sustains, every part of his extensive family,
both in heaven and earth.
The mourning of his heritage is as audible to his ear,
as hosannas of the fixed inhabitants of his holy mountain.

For our part, we seem (I mean the Society) to live in great union,
but I fear the unity of the one ever blessed Spirit is not the source,
but rather an agreement to let things go as they may or will,
without much care about them; and if any are zealous for the testimony,
rather to single them out as turners of the world upside down,
and troublers of the church`'s quiet.

For my own part, I am very much like a disbanded soldier, or, I hope, more of an invalid,
yet in some little pay, and commanded to do duty in a particular spot of ground;
and let my Master`'s good pleasure be done, and let him send by whom he will,
if I may but know my name is upon his roll, it is enough for me.
We have lately had the company of a great stranger;
my brother John spent a few weeks at Scarborough, and returned this way to London:
his company was acceptable as a brother and as a friend.
I hope it may contribute to his health, and the relaxation of his mind from a cumber,
in which it is very difficult for the plant of renown to flourish.

I feel that I am exceedingly near you at this time in my spirit.
I think your yearly meeting at Philadelphia begins this day;
may the God and Father of sure mercies preside; and as, in the allotment of his wisdom,
he hath seen meet to prove you deeply,
may wisdom and knowledge be the stability of your times.
The establishment of a Meeting for Sufferings was by many amongst you little thought of,
as you sat under your own vine and fig-tree;
many of you have rejoiced in the flowings of worldly abundance,
and not sung to the springing well of God`'s salvation,
and it is consistent with his righteousness to vary his voice,
and teach them by the things they suffer, what is due to his arm,
and the weakness of our own.

Dungannon, Ninth month 9th, 1737.

I have often thought of thee of late, and I think,
alway attended with strong desires that thou might be sent to visit us in this nation,
which may truly be said to languish as to the life of religion,
but am afraid to expect such a thing suddenly,
when I consider the weight that lies on thy shoulders in your own land,
a painful sense of which I have more than once felt, and in my small measure,
have sympathized with thee and some others therein; indeed, if I have felt right,
the number of those who are rightly baptized
into the state of the church is few with you,
as well as here, considering the number of professors; yea,
and of those who lay claim to something of sacred embassy to the people.
But, alas, many of them are too superficial to feel the states,
and much less capable effectually to prescribe for the
recovery from those things which weaken and afflict the body.
It is indeed a cause of sorrow to behold the
leanness and dryness that has overtaken many;
and when a comparison is made between the present state of the church,
and that healthful, active, green, fruit-bearing condition,
which dignified our worthy predecessors, at,
and after the breaking forth of truth amongst them,
the declension from the life of religion, simplicity of the gospel, and nobility of mind,
is very apparent.
The making of such a comparison doth often affect my heart with pain,
and strong are my desires that the few faithful,
to whom it hath been given to see into the depths of Satan, may yet wax more mighty,
in the wisdom and power of the Highest.

Dear Samuel, I am afraid to enlarge, not only as considering to whom I am writing,
but also that it may not be lawful at all times to speak or write what we see or feel;
but having often, as at present,
felt the free circulation of that unity of spirit which the
Father of lights hath vouchsafed to give to his children,
as a bond of holy fellowship--by which, though dispersed in different lands,
we are bound in one bundle of love, and notwithstanding far absent in body,
yet present in spirit,
being as epistles in each other`'s hearts--I thought I
would venture to give thee these few lines.

Kelvedon, Ninth month 10th, 1757.

I should some days ago have made thee a sharer of the
satisfaction I felt on my return to my native land,
resulting both from a sense of having been absent
therefrom in the wise appointment of Heaven,
and the gracious, supporting, preserving hand of the Most High having been with me,
for which my soul bows in thankfulness, and I hope I may say,
all within me worships His holy name,
with desires to be devoted to his service through the residue of my life;
but that this dispensation of life and peace was very quickly succeeded by its contrary,
wherein I could not determine to address thee,
rather choosing to commit the keeping of my soul to God, than to my fellow servants.
He no doubt, in the wise appointment of his providence,
permits and appoints these alternations of light and darkness,
as preservatives to his people.

I am now, through mercy, a little relieved,
and I hope settled in my former service of ministering
principally to the members of our own Society,
which,
being very different to that wherein I had been engaged on the other side of the water,
it is no wonder that I must be immediately stripped of the clothes I then wore,
and be clothed with a new suit, which I was ready to think, when first put on,
were the plainest I ever wore,
yet I hope suitable to the occasion and time wherein I
am appointed to serve in the Lord`'s house,
which appears to me to be a time wherein the people are
not to be delighted with eloquent oratory,
but instructed by plain, simple truths, suited to their states,
in which ministration I ardently desire we may both grow.
Doubtless I wanted to be washed, as well as to change my garments,
having been long amongst men of unsanctified spirits,
although perhaps not such as are looked upon by the world as the worst sort:
but I have found by experience that it is exceedingly difficult to converse
much with those whose desires are not subject to the yoke of Christ,
without contracting a tincture of that infectious lightness
which appears in the whole course of their conduct.

We were eight days wind-bound at Helvoetsluys,
during which time we were in company with several who came in the same packet to England,
and but that I had some hope that it might some
time be rendered serviceable to some of them,
would have rendered our stay much more disagreeable.
I know not but this little trial at the close of
our journey might be profitable for us all,
as it might further instruct us in the necessary lesson of patience,
wherein I found I had need to be better learned.

My dear companion, Sophia Hume, left me this afternoon, being gone to London.

Philadelphia, Ninth month 15th, 1757.

Public affairs on this Continent are remarkable for the confusion which attends them.
None of the attempts in a military way have answered the expectations of the people, but,
on the contrary,
everything they have yet prepared to do hath contributed to strengthen the French.
I do not incline to be particular, further than to remark,
that in proportion to the increase of these tumults, so, in some measure,
advance the trials and probations of our poor Society.
And, amidst all the gloomy prospects,
I am at times led to conclude none occasions more sorrowful reflections,
than the present state of the church, many of whose members,
by a long enjoyment of ease and tranquillity,
have become too insensible of the dignity of our calling,
and in this day of trial start aside; which affords occasion to look back,
and consider the close engagements and labours of the Lord`'s servants,
who have been sent amongst us, to warn, and caution,
and proclaim the necessity of being roused from the lethargy which hath prevailed,
in order to prepare for such a time of trial as hath overtaken us;
and happy would it have been, if more regard had been paid to such messages.
The testimony of the Prince of Peace would be less
violated than hath been too visibly the case lately,
by evasions and temporising,
of which there have been painful instances on a late occasion in the Jerseys,
where the day of trial hath been more closely
manifested than at any time during the late agitations;
the unfaithfulness of some hath contributed to the burdens of
the few who were concerned to stand their ground.

Amidst the present calamitous circumstances,
it affords cause of thankfulness that the extendings of
Divine regard are so signally manifested towards us,
by the continuance of the messengers of the gospel, sent to labour amongst us;
we have now six European Friends in these parts,
the company of all of whom we expect at our approaching yearly meeting.
John Hunt hath spent most part of the summer in this province, where his ministry,
and other Christian endeavours, have been attended with evidences of divine favour.

Our Meeting for Sufferings hath met pretty diligently since its establishment,
and a variety of occurrences have presented;
in the transaction whereof I hope nothing hath been
done to the disadvantage of the cause of Truth.

I cannot but acknowledge how much I am obliged to thee for thy kind letter,
which I shall endeavour duly to regard.
It gives me some satisfaction to be so far noticed by the Lord`'s servants,
and I am frequently desirous of so conducting as to be
preserved at least from injuring the testimony,
or of administering uneasiness to them.

Thy affectionate lines I esteem an additional
confirmation of the continuance of that friendship,
wherein, so long as I am divinely assisted to be steadfast in the pursuit of true peace,
I shall always have cause to rejoice.
Sure I am, that notwithstanding the ties of nature in external affinity are strong,
there seems to me to be in the Truth connections much more firm,
by which the really living in the body, whereof Christ Jesus is the holy head,
are united one to another.
As we are humbly and reverently engaged to keep in this unity,
no greater joy will be experienced by any one of us than a confirmed
sense of the increasing strength in ourselves and fellow-members,
and the advancement of each individual in Divine favour.

Thy remark, that "`to move in the line of Divine appointment,
is our strength and safety,`" is, I doubt not, the language of well-grounded experience,
and I trust will be at times profitably suggested to me
when doubts and wavering surround my weak mind.

The Western yearly meeting, held at Milverton, was, in several of its sittings,
greatly overshadowed with the life-giving presence and power of the Most High,
to his own glory, and the comfort of many,
who I believe have returned to their own habitations with peace and gladness.
Isaac Sharpless, Edmund Peckover, Samuel Hopwood, John Fry, William Cookworthy,
and six or eight other ministers were there;
the service of the meeting was pretty much on the first two;
there was a little company met early on the first-day morning preceding the meeting,
and six or seven elders were desired to have the oversight of the ministry,
and to caution privately where occasion might offer;
I believe the meeting was upon the whole satisfactory,
both to those of our Society and others.
The people will be glad of future opportunities of this kind.

Be assured I am not insensible of my own condition,
and of the need I have to be watched over as a child,
and I think greater poverty and weakness seem to be my daily experience;
that this dispensation may be patiently (not
with supineness and indolence,) acquiesced in,
that the will of the Highest may be thoroughly done, in and by me, is my earnest desire.
I have been often brought to more than willingness to
be what the Lord would have me to be,
but under the operation of his hand there is need of patience, which,
if he graciously furnish, it will be sufficient.

He was of a respectable family; his father, a wealthy man, was a Protestant, and,

Nothing but the deepest sense of inward poverty
could have so long prevented my writing to thee,
my dear and near friend.
But thus it hath been, that I have not dared to meddle with religious things;
when I have done it, especially in writing, it has been with rebuke,
and now I am at a loss what to add.
That my love is as entire to thee as so low a creature is capable of,
is fixed and certain.
But what shall I say?
O my leanness, my leanness--it is beyond expression, and so sensibly felt by me,
that I dare not as it were extend any further, lest I should defile God`'s jewels.
Though a beggar may have a prospect of the order and beauty of God`'s house,
and can even at a distance see, and apprehend he can distinguish the furniture of it,
yet shall he presume, while clothed in rags, to enter therein?
Will he not defile the same, and be the greater object of scorn, instead of pity?
Perhaps a time may come when a washing and pulling off
the filthy rags of nature may be known,
and a belter clothing experienced.

Thus far I have written, and that not without a rebuke,
but could not longer delay expressing my sincere love to thee, dear friend.
Why is it so with me?--if thou hast any comfort or counsel to communicate,
do it I beseech thee.

This may just inform you that I yet live, although my suffering at times is considerable,
both in head and heart.
Indeed, such is the state of the church in general,
that I think I am called to suffer with it,
both in body and mind--the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
The mystery as well as the misery is, that so few lay it to heart, or seek relief.
To have the earth cleave under us, or the sea overflowing us,
would cause great lamentation and outcry; yet to see the world, earth and sea,
swallowing up almost whole counties, in a religious sense, and we at ease,
and thinking all is well, is surprising.

Thy letters were to my comfort--as a glass wherein we sometimes see one
another--so excellent is this kind of correspondence to distant friends;
sometimes like apples of gold in pictures of silver--pictures set up in our best room,
i+++.+++ e. the heart--or as nails in a sure place--or as goads, to prick one another forward,
or to keep back; for poor oxen, old oxen, with a load, go heavily and dully up hill,
and sometimes run too fast down.
These epistles renew the epistles formerly written in our hearts;
such have been thy kind letters with divers others from worthy friends.
I received one from John Pemberton, and one from John Churchman, who says,
"`We are now going to an Indian treaty, to be held at Easton, in Bucks county,
though we have been repeatedly informed by the governor
that it was his desire we should not attend,
as we had done at sometimes heretofore,
from an intimation which he had received from the Proprietary,
that it was offensive to the Ministry in England.
Our sense of duty in this affair, at this critical conjuncture,
is too deeply impressed to be rubbed out by repulses, or disdainful flouts,
arising from misconstructions of our intentions,
which are pretty liberally bestowed on us at present; but our proceedings,
manifesting the sincerity of our intentions, when they come to appear in public view,
may set things in another light.`"

Thus we see how that which lets will let, until it is taken out of the way; but, surely,
if Friends keep their places in the Truth,
there is no sword formed against it which will prosper,
and every tongue rising against its judgment, will be condemned.
And I am persuaded that stillness and patience, when we have done our duty honestly,
are safest to abide in;
and it will be seen that the Lord will make a way for his Truth and people,
and their enemies will fall.

I came almost directly from the Northern dales to this place.

Let us not forget the rock, nor the hole of the pit from whence we were dug:
it is a rugged place to get to and from--I left it too soon.
If I should have my age renewed, and wings as an eagle,
or as a giant refreshed with wine from the true Vine; or, in thy language,
warmed with fire from above; or, if my Master would give the signal,
and array me with his own livery, I would venture his pay.
This, with dear love, from your poor old friend,

Warrington, Tenth month 3rd, 1757.

I am poor, very poor: I have a fund of affection and tenderness,
but even that is at times almost inaccessible, and then how can I bring it forth?
I may claim thy affectionate sympathy, and perhaps,
if at any painful hour the like may attend thee, it may suggest relief,
in that thou art not alone.
The alternations of light and darkness are necessarily appointed;
in the first creation of this world, night intervened betwixt the days; if so,
in the days of purity and innocence, what may not be expected,
when transgression and offences have brought an interruption of order and harmony?
Nay, if the Almighty Former have renewed into newness of nature,
the day and the night remain in Divine wisdom,
in the necessary variety of the new creation, that each may show forth their wonders,
and speak his praise who ordained them.
Thus, beloved sister, friend,
and fellow traveller towards the mountain where the Lord rests,
having finished his work to perfection, we may learn to rejoice in tribulation,
sustained by a lively hope that neither heights nor depths, things past, present,
nor to come, shall separate us from that love which is stronger than death,
though the trials thereof may be manifold.

I am relievingly sensible of best help and
strength renewed to act and live to my own peace,
and the advantage of others; as a person, embarrassed in a dark wilderness,
without a path or light, beholds with joy the return of day,
and the prospect of the dwellings of men, so hath my exercised spirit, after a painful,
yet profitable baptism, again beheld His face in the Light,
and found myself amongst his shepherds`' tents;
may the gain and glory be ascribed where it is ever due.
I am, in the bonds of sincerest affection, thy loving brother,

Philadelphia, Tenth month 13th, 1757.

I am at times mercifully favoured with a degree of that united love,
which in its Divine nature and efficacy cements the hearts of its true votaries,
and makes them dear to each other, though personally unacquainted.
It is in this sort that thou, my friend, hast been often brought to my mind,
as well as a near remembrance of the deep travail and unwearied
labour of thy dear husband in the glorious work of the gospel,
in which my spirit hath frequently been greatly refreshed
under a variety of exercises and close baptisms.
And I doubt not but many besides myself do both now, and will hereafter,
reap the advantage of excellent fruits produced by his ministry,
as well as that of divers others of our valuable friends,
eminently gifted and qualified and sent to us in an acceptable time,
which to me seems an evident demonstration of heavenly regard,
and that the everlasting Arm of Sufficiency is still stretched forth to gather a people,
whose progenitors were not only blessed with the dew of heaven,
but also with the fatness of the earth.
Outward peace and tranquillity filled their borders,
and the sound of war they were strangers to; but, alas! the scene is greatly changed,
and I believe many of the offspring of those worthies,
who are entered into their heavenly mansions,
have too lightly esteemed their fathers`' God, and the Rock of their salvation.
Nevertheless, there is yet a number whose trust and confidence is in him alone,
and these at times are favoured with the spirit of intercession,
that the descendants of his people may not be cast off,
but that he may be graciously pleased yet to make choice of them,
though it may be in the furnace of affliction.

This is designed to go by our valuable friend Thomas Gawthorp,
whose visit has been very acceptable and serviceable, I believe in general,
and in a particular manner to myself,
having his company in the house at a time when nearly tried;
my only daughter being visited with a dangerous illness, which reduced her so low,
that for many days I despaired of her recovery, and she herself did not expect it.
Though she had been a hopeful child, it was to her a season of deep probation,
and a winnowing time,
in which the Lord was pleased to manifest to her the emptiness of
every temporal enjoyment without that of his Divine presence,
for which she was in great distress; and as it hath pleased him to raise her,
even from the brink of the grave, I hope, and earnestly desire, it may prove a lasting,
profitable visitation to her.
She, with the rest of our children,
retain an affectionate remembrance of thy dear husband, and entertain, at times,
a pleasing prospect of once more seeing him in Philadelphia,
at which many beside them would rejoice.

East Nottingham, Tenth month 15th, 1757.

I think that this yearly meeting,
during the time of our sitting on the affairs of the Society,
was as much favoured as any meeting I was ever in; which is, indeed,
great cause of solemn thankfulness.
We had the company of many of our youth, who sat with a reverent attention,
and some spoke to the business to my admiration; so that,
notwithstanding all our troubles, which are many,
I dare not yet conclude that the Lord intends to destroy us,
but rather to instruct by a rod of correction.

Dear Samuel, as to myself, I dare not say much,
being never more sensible that of myself I am weakness altogether.
I have known few times of greater purgation than of late,
which has made way for a greater degree of purity for a time,
and the text says--The pure in heart shall see God; and, indeed,
it is only in a state of purity that the Lord reveals his secrets,
and opens those things which to the world and its spirit have
been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

In many places there is a young generation coming up,
who will take the burden willingly upon them, not of constraint, but of a ready mind,
and the work will prosper in their hands,
though at present they may be reproached by such Sauls, who, at times,
know the anointing is upon the young, and the spirit is in them,
though departed from themselves, because of disobedience:
and who more jealous and spiteful than such at times are?

Philadelphia, Tenth month 17th, 1757.

I herewith send thee a new edition of John Everard`'s writings;
a book on the reading of which, often, light and a degree of life have been communicated.
Doubtless thou art not unacquainted with it; but,
as it is scarce to be met with amongst you,
I thought it might not be unacceptable to thee or thy neighbours.
However,
it is the best token I am at present capable of sending thee of my remembrance and love;
which is as sincere and entire as my poor weak heart is capable of.
May the Almighty be thy guide and strength!
Painful in many, very many respects, is our situation, particularly mine,
under an uncommon sense of poverty and desertion.
O, the weakness, the instability, the self,
the remains of a subtle pride that hangs about human nature,
even of those that are esteemed good and wise in the main.
How liable to change, waver, and run from one extreme to the other.
Well, I hope I am cured from any more dependence and expectation from man.
May I steadily seek comfort and establishment in God alone, by retirement, silence,
and prayer!

I have often desired to write to thee at large,
concerning the present situation of our affairs, but have been let hitherto,
for want of a sufficient freedom thereto.
Perhaps it is best it should be so.
I may with pleasure say, there continues to be a great shaking amongst our dry bones;
the hearts of many amongst us, especially the youth,
are touched with love and zeal for God; may they abide the trial better than I have done,
and escape the many snares which the enemy seems
to strengthen himself to lay in their way.
The world and the flesh allure on the one hand, and when that is in measure overcome,
another dangerous snare presents, from a kind of enthusiastic spirit,
which I apprehend very much prevails, and often, too often,
presents itself amongst the sons of God, even in otherwise honest-hearted ones.
A mixed fire,
in a great measure proceeding from the passions of the creature being
warmed and raised by that which has the appearance of zeal,
and even in some, I have feared, from the melody of their own voice,
which makes the creature imagine it is as on the mount, when its fruits, its spirit,
and its brethren`'s religious sense declare it is not.
And this spirit, not being sufficiently learned by that meekness, diffidence and doubt,
which accompanies the true gospel, is impatient of contradiction,
and very apt to smite at the honest fellow servant,
when put on reexamining its attainment, prospect, and foundation.
From these two extremes, joined to my own great poverty, arise pain,
and often deep anxiety.
I need not desire thee to excuse my irregularity and freedom.
I know thy sympathizing heart can bear with the poor and weak.
Only I would desire that, as often as thou finds freedom,
thou wouldest let me hear from thee.

I salute thee, dear friend, and thy wife, and in the nearest and dearest manner,
bid thee farewell.

Dudley, Eleventh month 11th, 1757.

Our quarterly meeting is to be held at Worcester; I should be truly glad of thy company,
where perhaps it might be singularly serviceable, as nothing has been done in my absence,
in America, towards the proper settlement of a meeting of ministers and elders,
and it is hard for me to act single handed in such weighty affairs.

I am convinced that the bond of our friendship is purity,
and a joint concern for the honour of God, and for the good of mankind;
and I have long thought,
if we are mutually favoured to keep our places in the church militant,
some singular good will accrue from it.
It is the earnest, steadfast prayer of my soul,
that the purposes of Him who has graciously called us into his vineyard,
in the morning of our day,
may be fulfilled by our steady advancement from stage to stage in our sacred employment,
and acting in every station and relation appointed to us in life,
to the honour of Him that has called us to glory and to virtue.

I can say truly,
that for a series of years I have had nothing so much in view as the
filling up that measure of righteousness whereunto I am called;
and if, in looking forward in life, I have been suffered to take in any prospect,
which in the apprehension of some might savour of creaturely gratification,
it has been in the simplicity of my heart, from its appearing with the face of rectitude,
at the same time standing open to the immediate convictions of Truth,
or the intermediate assistance of its servants in the suppression of delusion;
and if I am at last suffered to fall, it is with an anxious desire to stand,
let the consequence, with regard to the body or things appertaining to this life,
be what it may.
To give up the world, even at the Divine command,
and in exchange for an infinitely better inheritance,
to a mind that is centered therein appears much,
but to one that can reap no satisfaction from any temporal good,
but as it is received and used as the gift of God, it is a small matter;
and as to partake of it affords to the one a delusive pleasure,
so to the other pain and anxious care,
which is only rendered easy or tolerable by a sense of being engaged therein,
in and by the direction of Heaven:
so true do we find by experience that assertion of our Lord,
"`In the world ye shall have trouble, but in me peace.`"
My mind, dear friend, has been very humblingly exercised for some days past, which may,
perhaps, have fixed these thoughts rather deeper than usual.

In my late turn amongst you, I may say, with the Apostle, I was with you in weakness,
in fear, and in much trembling of soul, and was more likely to conclude that I had lost,
than gained strength and wisdom, in the exercise of the gift I am entrusted with;
which humbling dispensation I know was profitable, at the close of a journey,
wherein I had been sometimes remarkably favoured.

Lancaster, Twelfth month 4th, 1757.

Thy lines were very acceptable to me indeed,
joining so much in one with the concern of my own mind,
in which I was ready to think I had been almost, if not altogether alone;
and notwithstanding the weight we have laboured under,
from the sorrowful apprehension and gloomy views we have had;
from all which we have been deeply bowed in supplication, with the cry of--"`Oh, Lord,
spare thy people,`" and yet, still resigning all to an all-seeing, all-wise Providence,
who only knows the turning of every heart, and the humiliation of every soul,
and can divert his judgments as he will:
in whose will and holy counsel may we ever stand fast!
for I believe that what he suffers and brings to pass,
in this nation, will turn out to his own praise and honour,
and to the glory and enlargement of his church.
I was truly glad on reading of thy visit to London.
My spirit said "`Amen`" to it, yea,
and prayer filled my soul to Him that hath all wisdom and power,
that he might not only put thee forth, but also clearly give thee to see thy way, place,
and service, in every meeting, preserving thee still within the bounds of thy commission,
rather within than over, for a shortness is easier to mend than an overplus,
while sometimes the fervour of our spirits is ready, without steady care and watching,
to take a flight, to the detriment of the whole: thou wilt bear with me,
as an old friend, who has in measure learned to know the depths of Satan,
and also some degree of the majesty of godliness.
My love to thee runs parallel to that of my own soul.
May the Rock of Israel`'s strength, safety, and refreshment be daily revealed,
for thee to lean upon; that in body and soul, which are his,
thou may be supported to finish thy service abroad,
and to return with a weighty sheaf of peace, is the sincere desire of my soul.

It is not without difficulty that I write,
having for two months past been more troubled with my old complaint, the asthma,
than ever before; though I manage to get to meetings mostly,
yet it is with much hardship, for my breathing is so obstructed,
that I can speak but a few words together.

Warrington, Second month 12th, 1758.

So strong and engaging is that precious unity,
which is the bond and cement of the family in heaven and earth,
as often to bring each other into fresh remembrance;
the connection is stronger than nature suggests: and in a fresh spring thereof,
my mind this evening was a little warmed towards thee; though, indeed,
such is my present poverty and leanness as to furnish little worth thy notice,
unless it be agreeable to know that I feel a relation
to thee in the tribulation of the gospel of Jesus;
in which tribulation I can at times rejoice:
so it behooves the gospel minister to follow his Captain and Lord,
who was made perfect in the feelings of humanity, and if possible,
added glory to his divinity, by suffering and crucifixion.

My house hath not been so ordered with God,
but that I have administered too frequent occasion for anxiety and sorrow.
I hope I have learned from the things I have suffered to be more vigilant for the future,
and endeavour evermore to keep the holy fire alive and burning,
to dress the daily sacrifice; for when that once ceases,
abomination will stand in that place,
which ought to be a receptacle for the Lord of purity and perfection.

I write it with a deeply feeling heart; I have nothing to glory in but in the Lord,
and in his showing mercy and lovingkindness;
my goings in his service and sanctuary are imperfect;
weakness and imbecility in his work at times cover me with confusion,
and in times of greatest help and blessed owning, I can say righteousness belongs to him,
who only is holy, but unto me blushing and confusion of face.

It is a great and glorious thing to possess our vessels in sanctification and honour,
meet for the reception of the oil of consolation;
and to have our garments so unspotted from the dust, as to bear an invariable,
uniform resemblance of that attire,
which is a garment of praise throughout the extensive
regions of our Lord and Master`'s empire.

I write this undesignedly, and without as much doubt of thee as of myself,
O may we wait in the court of the temple the appointed time,
for our admission into that which is within the veil,
and improve to profit every revolution of the Lord`'s seasons,
whether they are the singing of birds,
the joyful chorus of souls raised at times above the clogs of mortality, or,
with immaculate Purity and the Heir of Glory, breathe out, __Eloi, lama sabachthani.__

Few, very few, there are who are baptized into this cloud; there are many instructors,
even amongst us, who had need to be afresh instructed in the oracles of religion;
a superficial ministry in some places hath prevailed, and in others,
imperfect births and deformed productions have proclaimed,
in the ears of the intelligent, their remoteness from the Lord of order.
If ministers are not baptized into the cloud--which, though dark and heavy,
has in it the Divine rain--they cannot minister of its dew to others.
Men, yea corrupt men, may hold their persons and gifts in admiration,
and speak well of them,
but praise of the uninitiated is a wound to the soul of the true servants,
who seek their Master`'s praise, and not their own.
Where the Lord hath dignified his servants, and made them angels indeed,
they have been lusted after with disguised impurity, as the angels sent to Sodom were.
It remains, therefore, for us, dear friend, to watch unto prayer,
that we may stand in the trying day,
and be enabled to fill up our places with dignity and usefulness,
and close our race with peace.

I may just add,
no time of my pilgrimage hath elapsed wherein I have found greater
necessity to walk in daily reverence for my own keeping,
and for the discharge of the portion of labour allotted me in the vineyard,
fervently to petition: Lord, give me wisdom, for I am but a child.
He who allots our stations in his service,
points them also out to his servants in the visible church.
There is great need to ask counsel of our Counsellor,
in the various events attending these mortal vessels,
and especially in momentous affairs, where much of the well-being of life,
and that in the highest sense, is concerned.
There never was any offer made to thee (at least that I heard of,)
which carried so much probability of being in Divine direction,
as this now under thy consideration:
the superiority of outward enjoyments which he possesses, preferably to the other offers,
by no means decides with me: I believe there is a similarity of mind, and an engagement,
in his measure, for the good cause, which propose an union and fellowship,
all the riches of the world can never produce, but have often tended to destroy.
As a member of this county, I regret thy removal from us;
as a member of the church militant,
I approve the placing a candle in a room where it seems much wanted: I believe,
as thou waits in singleness of heart for wisdom and counsel,
it will be duly administered.

Farewell, dear friend; let us be mindful of our father`'s God; he remains to be ours;
and generation tells to generation his acts, and worships his everlasting arm.

I sat down to write to thee with a degree of ease and
serenity which promised some satisfaction;
but this was soon interrupted by a dry frame of mind,
that has indeed faded and dissipated every pleasing,
comfortable sensation I find no other way to a degree of stability and happiness,
but to study to be quiet, and mind my own business;
this I think includes acquiescence and resignation to every allotted dispensation;
a steady adherence to this, through the assistance of Providence,
may become more and more as a shelter and place of defence,
against the violent assaults of many distressing and distracting cares and
circumstances that daily present to busy and embondage the mind,
the part to be rendered happy or miserable, and we apprized of it, and left to choose;
and, though the conflict may be great, +++[+++there is]
a promise of being made overcomers,
if we faint not--the remembrance of which sometimes
revives with a little hope and fresh vigour,
when we are ready to sink.

Thy remarks on worthy Abraham Farrington^
footnote:[This worthy friend had finished his earthly course,
a short time before this was written, at the house of Thomas Jackson, in London,
who thus writes to Samuel Fothergill:--"`All care, both by advice and nursing-,
was taken of our dear friend Abraham Farrington, as he lived, so he died,
in great innocency and quietude, and no doubt,
is gone to rest with the blessed.`"--T. J.]
are affecting and just; but to reflect on the brightness of the setting sun,
spreads over the mind, on his account,
rather a pleasing sympathy with him in his happy change, than any painful regret,

Some person told me, before I left your country,
that I should love your Friends better when I got home than I did when present with you;
and I have found more in the remark than I at that time attended to.
My spirit often has fled, on the wings of love and sympathy,
to a region where it hath heretofore been warmed with
an ardour no sublunary enjoyment could ever inspire.
In which times I run from house to house, from one brother and sister to another.
As usual, I seem to enter with an inquiry, the result of affection, not of formality,
after their health, and depart with a most sincere farewell.
In this view thou art familiar with me, and the frequent companion of my mind,
distinguished from most in your land, with solicitude for thy health and establishment,
through the many inclement seasons, as well as more flattering events,
which in the course of thy pilgrimage fall to thy lot.

He in whose hands the winds are held, both the southern gale and the northern blast,
hath caused the former to blow upon thee in the sight of the many;
and the northern gale of pinching and trial hath also blown upon thee,
and demanded the sympathy of the few, who,
versed in the alternate revolutions of the Lord`'s year,
praise him for summer`'s heat and winter`'s storms; for the stormy wind,
fulfilling his word, was called upon, as well as the rolling stars of light,
to declare his praise.

I have known times of sitting by the waters of Babylon,
and weeping when I remembered Zion; but when I have looked into the holy sanctuary,
I have seen afflictions and sorrow are more the result
of our own conduct than the Divine intention.
If we fully follow him in all his leadings, the Lord`'s way would, to many of us,
be a plainer path than we find it.
Great is the advantage of faithful obedience; it sweetens every cup,
and speaks peace to the soul.
Unmixed sincerity towards God is an excellent sweetener
of all the cups we drink of from the fountain of Marah;
but where the secret consciousness of want of true resignation and humble following on,
preys upon the mind, such cannot fly with boldness to the altar of God,
where even the swallows have a place allotted.
May best wisdom and fortitude be the clothing of thy mind, and peace,
and the answer of "`Well done,`" be thy portion forever.

I sat down to tell thee that I remembered thee;
my pen hath run on in a manner I did not expect, perhaps, in an improper one.
However, this I know, love, stronger than death, seasons my spirit,
in which I affectionately salute thee and all thy children; I love them nearly,
and the Lord loves them, and would make them his in an everlasting covenant.
O, that their hearts might but enough prize the blessed visitations of his mercy,
and by an early choice of the paths of wisdom and truth,
fill up their duty to their parents, their God, and his people, in this their day,
that the diadem of peace might be with them forever.

I have not forgotten the relief which I at times met with when in your country,
by Friends mitigating the inevitable pain of absence,
by giving my wife some account of me,
when I might be prevented doing it by such engagements as
necessarily attended a sincere endeavour to discharge my duty
in the service of our ever worthy Lord and Master.
Experience hath taught me sympathy,
and the very sincere regard I have for thy dear husband, thyself, and the children,
demands a testimony of it on the present occasion.
I was, by a slight indisposition,
prevented accompanying him to a quarterly meeting in Cheshire,
to which he set out this morning, accompanied by my wife and Samuel Emlen,
and we expect him here again in a few days.

He is bravely in health, and inwardly and outwardly well,
being preserved in that happy stability which is
in the middle of the path of true judgment.
His service is truly acceptable to the living;
and by the haste he is allowed by his wise and gracious Master to make,
may be expected to be clear sooner than many others that have come here from your land.
The tender connections of nature, confirmed by the yet stronger cement of Divine love,
which establish your union, will doubtless often suggest a secret,
anxious wish for his return to his beloved relatives;
but whilst natural affection prompts to wish his return home,
may a suitable deference ever be paid to that direction which is wise,
and in whose sacred allotment the joyous events of human life are sanctified,
and the adverse rendered sweet.
I early felt with and for thee,
when he was suffered to fall into the hands of unreasonable men;^
footnote:[Mordecai Yarnall, whilst on his passage from America to Europe,
was captured by the French, but was soon released.]
but He whom thy dear husband served set bounds to their wrath,
and vouchsafed a speedy deliverance.
And why may we not suppose the Lord of the harvest, perfectly wise,
in now and then lighting a candle in those lands where darkness prevails?
It is, doubtless, consistent with his sovereignty and goodness,
who would bless the utmost borders of his ample empire,
and make the place of his feet glorious.
He who cares for the sparrow, and hath numbered the hairs of our heads,
mercifully presides among his people, divides the spoil to those who, in his strength,
go out to war, and allots a share to those who stay at home,
in their duty filling up their places.
I am persuaded, beyond a doubt,
that the merciful Father cares for what we leave behind us,
blesses often with prosperity, and always with patience, as we look towards Him.
If outward affairs are not beneath his providential notice,
how much more those to whom we stand in a nearer relation--those pledges of mutual love.
The example of tender parents may be in measure vacated,
yet the deficiency is made up by the interposition of
the ever-present and all-sufficient Father.
I remember, and at this time it is fresh with me, that in my honourable father`'s absence,
he being in your land, the humbling, converting Hand effectually prevailed with me,
to embrace the day of his visitation.
And my heart is anxious that you, the beloved offspring of the Lord`'s servant,
may be enriched with the same blessing,
and that you may give up your names to be inserted in the roll of the Lord`'s servants,
which is the Lamb`'s book of life.
For this his prayers ascend, who, having proved the service of the Most High,
has found it to be freedom and perfect liberty.
May a holy union of spirit unite the whole together,
that you may availingly follow after those things which make for your peace;
and may innocent hands be put up to the Almighty,
for a beloved father`'s return to you in safety, and with sheaves in his bosom.

With a heart replenished with unfeigned love, I salute thee, dear friend,
and all the children capable of receiving it, and am thy very affectionate friend,

I received thy acceptable letter, and as I am often anxiously thoughtful about you,
and solicitous for your establishment in the best things, the account thou gave me,
confirmed by several others,
of the gracious continuance of best help towards you in
the last yearly meeting was truly acceptable.
May the wisdom which is from above, with all its train of divine companions--faith,
meekness, stability, and charity--be more the clothing of our spirits;
and then shall we know a right improvement of mercies past,
and a meetness for those yet within the veil.
And when I consider the extent of unmerited condescension towards our Society in general,
and to many particulars in an especial manner, for their own help,
and the substantial edification of the body, my heart almost dissolves within me,
and fervently begs protection and preservation for all in the heavenly hierarchy,
that they may bear, without a mixture, in their countenances,
the resemblance of kings`' sons,
waiting for the renewed discovery of their part
in the universal tribute of obedience and praise,
and strength to yield it; that nothing may ever prevail,
either in the latent source of our conduct, or be admitted at all to tincture it,
that is not of the Lamb,
or distort our features with the emotions of passions
repugnant to those of the heavenly family.
I know we have great need often to have recourse to the pool,
and to come under the turning of that hand that
hath distinguished us from many of our brethren.
Oh let humility be our dwelling place, and the uniform rule of our conduct;
so shall the slippery path through time be trod with safety,
and our feet at last stand firmly within the gates of salvation.

I have spent some time agreeably with worthy Thomas Gawthorp since his return home,
having paid him a visit at his own house.
He hath not lost ground by his journey amongst you,
though his lot hath been in suffering since his return;
yet the answer of "`Well done,`" seems as a pearl in his field, most surely there,
though often concealed from view.

In all cases where contrary sentiments occur,
and where we are required earnestly to contend for the faith,
the more the meekness of the Lamb is adopted and abode in,
the more indisputably He is known to be the Lion of Judah`'s tribe,
going forth conquering and to conquer.
I sympathise nearly with such amongst you who dare not
turn aside from the directions of Heaven,
but follow the ark into Jordan.
May the holy covering of peace and meekness be upon them,
and it will be in the end a garment of praise.

I have never yet seen cause to recede from the judgment
of Friends who signed the Epistle of Love and Caution,
and I believe our yearly meeting will scarcely decide the point, or meddle with it.

Warrington, Third month 10th, 1758.

That affectionate regard that lived with me
towards thee from our very first acquaintance,
is by no means impaired by absence, for it is derived from that which doth not change;
in which I affectionately salute thee,
earnestly desiring thy perseverance and growth into a
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ;
being sensible that He who hath called thee by his grace,
and whose gifts and calling are without repentance,
would lead on towards perfection his children, whom he hath begot by his own power;
and although their path may be through the region of the shadow of death,
he is able to keep unto salvation.

Many, very many, are the obstructions in our way to the kingdom,
but our greatest enemies are those of our own heart; the corrupt, selfish will,
that wills not the things of God, is apt to get up,
and wants not its disguises to deceive and multiply sorrow.
It would choose and refuse, according to its own conception;
and as it is not subject to the Divine law, it cannot enjoy a place in the holy family,
who with one accord say, "`Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.`"
Dear John, how many sorrowful hours hath this revolting heart cost some of us,
in our wearisome pilgrimage, let experience testify.
On the contrary, when we seek singly the accomplishment of the Divine will, in and by us,
peace springs and flows like a river; our strength is renewed, and our youth,
like the eagle`'s. An increase in heavenly knowledge,
from the Alpha throughout the Divine progressive alphabet, from one letter to another,
even from the first to the last, is vouchsafed,
and the glory redounds to the ever worthy name.
In humbling, stripping times, we can kiss the rod,
and be instructed in patience and faith, in vigilance and holy fear.
Being well content with our allotment, if we have a place in His house, it is enough,
however low the station.
Permit me tenderly to suggest the query,
whether thou hast not covered thy face with ashes in mourning, at times,
through a disposition to choose thy service,
and to refuse it when prompt obedience was thine incumbent duty?
Yet the Lord of living mercy is mindful of thee for good; his hand is underneath,
though at times invisibly, in order to establish in peace and holy tranquillity.
But peace is sown for the truly obedient, and will,
after the revolutions of the appointed seasons, produce the desired fruit.

I nearly sympathise with the living amongst you,
in this dark and gloomy day that hath come upon your land; and oh, saith my soul,
that you may all stand, with your loins girt about,
having on the complete armour of light.
Thus innocence and fortitude will render these finally victorious,
and whatever may attend, your reward will be sure.

I am, through mercy, pretty well in health, and not idle,
finding work in my own vineyard, and according to my measure, in the church of Christ.
My wife is as well as for several years,
and joins me in the tenders of dear love to thy worthy, honourable mother and thyself.

Warrington, Third month 20th, 1758.

I was well pleased with the receipt of thine,
containing a circumstantial account of affairs amongst you,
together with some reflections upon several things which were just and proper.
These testimonies of regard and affection are allowably pleasing to me,
who often am present in spirit with many of you,
and rejoice in every event which promotes the real prosperity of that once happy land,
and am as sensibly pained with those occurrences which tend to its hurt.
Though, indeed, we are short sighted creatures; we see not the wheel within the wheel,
and often form a hasty judgment of those things we do see and feel.
Thus present afflictions are accounted evils,
and the shaking of the rod of the Highest over a forgetful people is more attended to,
and greater endeavours used to obviate it, than to search out the cause,
even the backsliding of the people, the constant spring of distress;
and no power can separate this effect from its original cause.
I trust many look into that which is within the veil,
and properly improve the present dispensation,
that they may be prepared to bear with benefit a relaxation of present sorrow, or,
what perhaps is nearer, the letting loose of the Lord`'s hand in terrible judgment.
I remark with joy the continuance of Divine favour towards you,
in repeated offers of his love by his servants.
Oh that each soul, sensible of these favours, may improve them to profit; for to many,
the dew of heaven is as water spilt upon a stone,
from not considering that they are mercies to be accounted for in the day of recompense.

The weakness, wickedness, and insincerity of your principal people in power,
are subjects of sorrowful consideration, and seem to me to threaten desolation,
instead of protection and help.
For when government, instituted for salutary purposes,
becomes either lax or perverted to repugnant purposes, it is a presage of calamity,
and made an engine of oppression.
But in the cloud is the way of the Sovereign of the world,
as surely as in the paths of light.
I meddle little with the public transactions of Europe,
but think the nations are as a boiling pot.
Wars, commotions, and bloodshed fill the awful scene,
and a spirit is let loose which breathes destruction I am sorry to
hear of the defection and cowardice of some in the Jerseys,
in flinching from their testimony.
Alas I what have we that we have not received?
and can we ever part with any portion of it for a better use,
than for His sake who giveth us all things richly to enjoy?
I sincerely wish all Friends may abide in the innocent quiet,
where counsel springs up in the needful hour, as it is sought in singleness of heart.
I find an increasing reluctancy in several minds against the payment of the land tax here.
Peradventure the time may approach,
in which the command may run thus,--Speak to my people that they go forward.
And perhaps the faithful amongst you may form the van.

Of worthy A. Farrington`'s departure, thou hast doubtless heard.
He finished his course well and bright; and that is enough,
whenever the appointed hour comes.

Thy sister Sarah Lloyd, is the frequent companion of my very affectionate remembrance.
Her portion is afflicting; to be cut off from the satisfactions of life,
innocent in their nature, and even laudable when rightly enjoyed,
and to remain in a constant state of indisposition, makes nature shudder.
But if the satisfactions, merely human, are much gone, its temptations are also weakened;
and no confinement so close, but he who entered,
"`the doors being shut,`" can find admission there.
The salutation of kind and tender love reaches to her,
and may the Holy One speak comfortably to her.
Thy assured, affectionate friend,

Neither time nor distance hath effaced thee out of my remembrance and near regard,
though perhaps, thou mayest almost have thought so.
Thou hast been the frequent companion of my mind,
with desires for thy growth and stability in those things which are most excellent;
and well assured I am,
thy morning light would be beautified with additional degrees of splendour,
if no unfaithfulness or want of right care on thy part
defeat the sacred design of that merciful one,
who is the Lord of perfection, and would have his sons and daughters like himself,
according to their age and growth.
That his blessed resemblance may be impressed upon thee, is my earnest prayer;
and in order thereto,
permit me to suggest a few such hints and cautions as
may arise in a mind anxious for thy good,
and warmed with the best love.

Study to be quiet, and mind thine own business, is one useful,
necessary direction to all who would thrive at home.
There is an active enemy, who seeks to draw out the mind after other people`'s business,
to the neglect of our own; whereby hurt and loss attend,
and the feet of the mind are gadding from house to house,
and abide not within our own doors.
The domestic affairs of the soul are neglected, the house gets unclean and confused;
and when the holy Head of the family and Husband of the soul, comes,
he finds things unmeet for his reception, and refuses to take up his residence.
Here some bemoan his absence,
which is chiefly or wholly owing to their want
of care in having all things clean and in order,
and being at home to receive him when he comes.

It is a common consequence of wandering much from home, to hear many reports,
whereby the mind feeds on wind; this is also ruinous and destructive.
It was not upon the mountains, or far off, that manna descended for Israel,
but even about their tents; and the celestial bread,
which hath been the staff of life to the living of all generations, is in our own houses;
the vein of fine gold runs in our hearts, there let us dig,
and patiently bear the refiner`'s hand.
Blessed is that servant who is found thus abiding and waiting at home;
when his Master comes, he will accept him, and make him ruler in his stead.
Here stands the power and ability of being rightly useful in the cause of truth,
whether in the church, or in our own families.
In this authority, the tender connections of nature,
improved by grace and confirmed by prudence, become a threefold cord,
that cannot easily be broken; and if we instantly see not the desire of our souls,
we shall not assume the Divine prerogative in fixing judgment,
or decline our patient waiting until our Lord comes, who can do all for us,
yea more abundantly than we dare expect or ask.

I now write that I may not seem to forget thee long together; forget thee, I cannot.
I have passed a laborious winter, unpleasant to myself in some respects,
but I hope not altogether unprofitable;
I mean not only with respect to temporal advantage--of this I
might have as much as one in a private station ought to look
for--but I gladly encourage the rising question,
To what end?
and I hope, in one respect or another, I am kept daily mindful, in degree,
of the winding up of all things.
Could I, by unwearied application, get myself more at liberty a few weeks hence,
to sit down with my friends at our ensuing solemnity here, I should be glad;
but of this I have not so much as the faintest hope.
I shall see you now and then as a traveller,
but if I can be kept so far alive as to rejoice when the will of heaven is done,
I shall be satisfied, if nothing more is permitted to be my portion.

Bristol, Fourth month 18th, 1758.

Our valuable friend Mordecai Yarnall and myself are both here, and through mercy,
pretty well in health,
and not insensible of the Divine vouchsafements of that help unto him,
which ever attends the willing in Israel,
though sometimes in seemingly less proportions than the creature may possibly desire, or,
according to our present senses,
may believe necessary for the advancement of that lovely cause in which we may,
by becoming sufficiently passive, be made instrumental.

I fear sometimes, greatly,
lest my failure to fill up properly the station
unerring wisdom designs for my standing in,
may yet prove not only ruinous to myself, but injurious to others,
whom in unmerited mercy he has reached unto,
and would bring forward towards a glorious rest, if the ascending path thitherward,
from an unwise imagination of its insurmountable difficulties, be not declined.
My footsteps are, I believe, marked oftener than I sometimes consider.
O may they leave the beauteous print of those shoes with which
our Heavenly Father guards the feet of his beloved children,
and with inviting language persuade others of the mercifully visited yet to step forward.

On the 11th we came to Chepstow,
where a meeting was held in the afternoon with the members of our Society.
It was a season of favour to us.
After this, some expected a select meeting of ministers and elders,
but I find they have not yet established such meetings in that principality;
the other meetings for discipline evince that things relative thereto are very low.
The three succeeding meetings for worship were very large.

I believe I am not alone in being pleased that the best qualified
instruments at these meetings were so very little interrupted,
or their intended service prevented, by the time being taken up by others.
I do not remember any yearly meeting in which the minds
of sensible Friends were less pained on this account.
I believe it exceeded that at Milverton in this respect;
but the minds of those ministered unto seemed less susceptible of profitable impressions,
than those who have attended the Welsh yearly
meetings allow to have been the case formerly;
too many there appearing invariably fixed in their own opinions.

Samuel Neale and Catharine Payton had an opportunity at
a crowded meeting here in the morning,
both I hope well.
She was really clothed with the best coat of mail,
and furnished with the weapons necessary among such spirits;
I hope to her own great humbling, as well as encouraging gladness,
in being so dignified by the great Master,
some of whose servants think it was a day of memorable distinction.
I think she is made more and more honourable.
O, may an increase of humility be her happy portion;
then will an advancement in Divine favour be yet administered,
notwithstanding the gradations she is already favoured with are indisputably great.

I wish, at the ensuing yearly meeting in London, to conclude as to my return home,
so as to be quite easy in myself,
and give no cause of pain to the minds of any of my true well-wishers,
amongst whom I have abundant cause to rank thee;
and therefore hope thou wilt look at this matter in thy own mind,
when any interval of leisure for it presents to thee; and that, with a father`'s freedom,
thy counsel may be made known before we meet each other.
I desire honestly to attend to the dictates of best wisdom, if vouchsafed.

I have seldom heard children blamed for telling their parents, guardians,
or friends where and how they are,
and should therefore have been apt to send thee a line for this purpose before now,
if my arrival at this place had been so early as I
expected at the time of our parting at Warrington.
As we purposed getting to Dudley meeting the next morning after leaving your town,
and the ride being pretty long,
thou would probably think it full as much as my little body was able for;
but to make this matter more easy,
we took a post chaise about sixteen miles of the very rough road,
and thereby easing ourselves and our horses,
we were favoured to get near sixty miles the first day,
and the next morning to Dudley meeting.
We found our friends there bravely in health.

I was much pleased, and hope to be profited, with my late visit to that family,
(Catharine Payton`'s). As it is now unlikely I shall ever see them more,
it is indeed joyous to believe,
that the Hand which has ever guarded and supported all
that have been steadfast to the end,
is yet evidently near for the continuance of their safety.
May the stay of thy young years be diligently looked unto; and I then trust,
notwithstanding fully as deep draughts of the bitter cup as nature is glad of,
may be sometimes handed, they will not tend to weaken in best things,
but thou wilt rather experience a happy increase in that Divine strength,
which formerly was desirable more than temporary ease and pleasure, which might, perhaps,
be greater if thy dear spouse`'s frequency from home did not interrupt.
But thou art by no means so covetous of his company as
to prefer thy own pleasure to public advantage,
wherein his Master evidently helps him to be useful;
and I think thee not ignorant that those that abide at home to
give necessary attention to the stuff are not forgotten,
but at times thou art plenteously rewarded by the holy replenishes,
to thy comfort and cause of thankfulness.

John Storer is undetermined about the place of his embarking for America;
here are vessels to sail for Philadelphia, New York, and Carolina,
that he may have his choice.
I want him to feel his own persuasion of mind in the matter;
it is not my place to say much in so important a concern;
he is not an entire stranger to that wisdom
which is profitable to direct and mighty to save.
May a diligent, honest attention to its direction be with him;
then I think he will yet witness preservation,
though his present state of mind seems not to be exaltation.

Thy very acceptable lines to Scarborough came in course;
the sympathy and instruction they express very strongly affected my mind,
then deeply humbled under a sense of weakness and want,
as a baptism preparative to the labour which opened before me,
in which I find more and more the absolute necessity of
resignation to His wise disposal who fills and empties,
abases and favours, in the proportions of His most perfect wisdom.
I have had additional proofs that all true sufficiency is in and of him,
and that for every difficulty; either in the heights or depths,
it is indeed a glorious sufficiency; may we lean upon it in every part of our race,
and it will safely sustain to the end of all our variously dispensed allotments.
I have been favoured with a good degree of inward and outward strength.

The meetings, as I have come along, have been generally very large,
and often favoured eminently with good,
so that I have reason to believe my coming was at the right time.
I came from our quarterly meeting at Lancaster, through Wensleydale:
I had meetings at Hawes, Counterside, Bainbridge, Aysgarth, Masham, Thirsk,
Kirby-moorside, and Pickering, and to Scarborough, where I remained nine days,
only made an excursion along with M. Yarnall to Burlington.
From Scarborough I came by Stentondale, Whitby, Stockton, Durham, Sunderland,
to this town, where were two very large and truly comfortable meetings.
As they were much composed of other people,
I have proposed a more select one of the members of the Society this afternoon,
and propose to set out tomorrow morning direct for Cumberland,
in which county I expect to stay some time.
Thus, dear sister, is my lot cast in close and hard labour, both of body and mind;
but every repining thought vanishes,
when I consider it is a stewardship in that house in which I
have been absolutely unworthy of the very lowest place.

Warrington, Ninth month 7th, 1758.

If our Lord and Master vary the dispensations of his providence, it is for some good end.
His plan, like his wisdom, is much more extensive than ours,
and if the confusions and coruscations in our allotment be
harbingers of some approaching manifestations of his own day,
to a greater degree of lustre, let us be content with our lot,
endeavouring after stability and dependence, that the Lord of the day may preside,
and direct the work of it.

Our yearly meeting at London was large and satisfactory;
the agreeable appearance of many youth comforted the souls of many who love Zion.
I think I have known the stream of the ministry rise higher,
but the meetings for discipline were eminently favoured.
There were several subjects considered and discussed,
in all which Truth prevailed against those who wanted to introduce greater liberties.

Soon after my return from London, I set out on a visit to some parts of Yorkshire,
Durham, Cumberland, and Westmoreland,
from which laborious service I returned two days ago,
and propose to set out early tomorrow morning for Kidderminster,
where the Circular yearly meeting for the seven
western counties begins on first-day next.
My journey was very laborious to body and mind;
many painful things are to be met with in such a journey,
especially where ministers are led into the state of the church to whom they minister.
Some secret causes of pain, and too many obvious ones,
render it distressing to trace the state of that vineyard
which the Almighty once planted in a fruitful hill.

Accept, my dear friend, to thyself and family,
the salutes of that affection that remains through all the vicissitudes of my life,

From the visit to the North of England, he returned with impaired health,
and his journey to attend the Circular yearly meeting increased his indisposition.
Total loss of appetite, want of rest, extensive inflammation of the lungs,
an incessant cough, and other symptoms of consumption,
caused serious apprehensions on his account,
and it was feared that his continuance in this life would be of brief duration.
His illness continued long,
but it pleased his good and gracious Master to raise him up again,
for further labour in his service.
Being thus rendered unable to attend the monthly meeting,
he returned his certificate with the following letter.

[.salutation]
Dear Friends,

It was my intention to have personally delivered to you the certificate,
you were pleased to grant me in the sixth month last;
but having been visited with a dangerous indisposition,
from which I am not wholly recovered, I am obliged to send it in this manner.

Agreeable to the prospect of duty I had when I requested your
certificate I was enabled to perform a visit to the meetings
of Friends in some parts of the North of Yorkshire,
the counties of Durham, Cumberland, and Westmoreland.
In the course of this visit I was often deeply affected with sorrow,
on account of the declension of many from the life and power of Truth,
who yet value themselves upon a name; but the heavenly salt being lost,
they are unsavoury,
and have brought dishonour upon the principle of Truth and its professors.
Yet often living encouragement to hope in ancient Help was administered,
and the powerful,
blessed effects of it made manifest in awakening a remnant
throughout the churches to prefer Zion to every other joy,
and to labour to build the Lord`'s house more than their own.
I know not what I can profitably add but this humble acknowledgment.
The Lord was with me, and overshadowed me often with the wing of his salvation.

I recommend you, dear Friends,
to a steadfast adherence to the Word of Wisdom and true judgment; these times require it,
for they are gloomy, and the mouths of multitudes are opened, and further opening,
against us; and alas for the occasion administered,
and the things found against too many of our members, not concerning the law of our God!

This morning, about the fourth hour, dear sister Hannah^

finished her course, which, in its conclusion, hath been uniform with her life, even,
peaceful, and quiet: she may be truly said to have fallen asleep,
after having in a happy degree served God in her generation.
The interment is to be on third-day next.
Your affection will lead you to sympathize with the afflicted family
on the solemn occasion of the removal of a head from eight children,
and a true helpmeet from a person enfeebled every way by indisposition,
though I hope he is better than some time ago,
and bears the stroke with a proper equanimity.

I continue better than I could expect:
I can scarcely moderate my feelings for those who are left, and the gap that is made.
I know it is best to be quiet, but my spirits are depressed by indisposition,
and I cannot command them.
The solemn peace and divine sweetness which evidently attended our sister,
are abundant proofs to me that she has entered into that society whose rest is sure.

Philadelphia, Eleventh month 27th, 1758.

I have now for a long time been much closed up from writing,
except where an apprehension of duty has made it necessary; and, indeed,
my mind remains still much the same in that respect;
yet I think it by no means proceeds from a want of real regard and love to my friends,
for it is my chief consolation,
that sincere love and affectionate fellowship
seem to flow more than ever towards those who,
in degree, bear the image, and abound in the love of our blessed Saviour.
Yet now I find some freedom,
and I apprehend somewhat of a necessity to lay my thoughts a
little open to thee with respect to our youth,
or I might rather say, the youth everywhere.
It is amongst these that the seed of corruption
first subtilely insinuates itself most strongly;
and notwithstanding exceptions to the contrary,
yet Solomon`'s words will generally prove true.
That the child trained up in the way that he should go, will not depart from it when old.
We are apt to doubt the general truth of this saying,
because experience shows us that the children of many good parents,
who have been concerned for the welfare of their offspring, go much out of the way;
and yet, if we consider what little effectual care is taken of the youth,
even of too many of the best amongst us, we shall not wonder at our ill success.
Some, doubtless, are really and vitally careful,
but it is generally an indulgent and partial care;
was it such a watchful care as the miser has to preserve and increase his wealth,
or the ambitious to gain honours, with a fervent application to God for help,
I doubt not that the effects would appear.
Ought not the educating and training up of the youth,
both with relation to time and eternity, next to our more immediate duty to God,
to be the chief concern of every one that really desires the
welfare and enlargement of the borders of Zion?
I have often thought that, next to preaching the Gospel,
the labour that is bestowed in preventing the influx of evil,
and in watching over every opportunity of instilling noble and
Christian principles into the tender minds of the youth is the
greatest and most acceptable sacrifice and service we can offer to
the great Father and Head of the family of the whole earth,
and the most exalted duty a Christian mind can be engaged in.
And it is, I think, observable, that even those children who,
notwithstanding great care has been taken in their education,
have suffered sin to prevail, so as to rush violently into evil, yet even in these,
the Christian labour which was bestowed on them when young,
has been as bread cast upon the waters,
and found again after many days of vanity and sin.
How many are there in the Society, of sufficient talents for educating the youth,
who are so situated as that by a moderate addition to their fortune,
which they might easily gain by this service, might live easily,
and have a mile to spare for the poor.
There are others whom God has so blessed with substance,
that they have nothing to do but to spend the income of it; yea,
time hangs heavy on their hands, and proves even a snare to themselves and others.
And there are some who, though they have already a large affluence of wealth,
yet are toiling hard to add thereto, without knowing wherefore they thus toil,
and whether a wise man or a fool shall possess it after them.
Many persons in these different situations are doubtless, in the main, honest souls, who,
though they find no call to the ministry, yet think themselves willing, with one of old,
to follow Christ wheresoever he goes.
Why then do they stand so long idle, when so large a field lies before them?
What account will many of these be able to give of their time, when every word,
and consequently every inch of time, must expect to be called into judgment?
What more beneficial employ, and more fruitful of comfort and joy in the end,
than time spent in an honest labour for the properly educating these innocent souls,
which the Almighty has clothed with flesh and blood, and by Divine help,
to be so enabled to watch over them,
as to frustrate the wiles and devices of the grand adversary,
that so these youth might truly answer the end of their creation?
What a beautiful and noble prospect do such thoughts open to the view
of those whose eyes are not blinded with the love of pleasure,
ease, or profit?
Why do so many suffer the god of this world so to blind their eyes,
and vitiate their reasonable as well as religious senses,
as to suffer them to toil after gain, and think it a mighty thing,
and themselves notably employed, if they can add £1,000 to £1,000, or £10,000 to £10,000,
and that often by a trade far from being pure from defilement;
as such gain often arises chiefly from the purchase and
sale of things at least needless and vain,
if not of a defiling nature.
An instance of this I have often painfully observed amongst us,
where it is frequent to see even Friends, toiling year after year, enriching themselves,
and thus gathering fuel for their own and their children`'s vanity and corruption,
by the importation and sale of large quantities of rum, etc., which,
though good in its place, yet from the enchanting allurement it is of to nature,
and from the excessive use of it,
may truly be said to be the greatest curse that ever befell the English nation,
and if possible, yet more so to the poor natives of this land.

That a man should labour to become rich, and amass wealth,
a state which our Saviour declares to be accompanied with snares and lusts,
which tend to destroy the soul--and that this should be attained by
the increase and importation of a commodity or commodities,
which, from the quantity already imported, proves the ruin of so many thousands;
is this keeping clear from defilement, and washing our hands in innocency?
Now, that such a person shall esteem himself, and be esteemed, a religious man,
and perhaps be the more regarded, even by religious people, because he is rich and great,
is a mere paradox; yet is it too often the case.
Now, as this is so conspicuous a weakness,
and much of this nature appears amongst many otherwise good people,
will any thoughtful man, who is in earnest,
desire to stay long in this vale of vanity and misery?
Alas! no; but I believe it is best to waive these thoughts,
and endeavour to centre in that chanty which believeth and hopeth for the best.
Perhaps this also often arises more from a wrong education, than from corruption of heart.
Mean and low prejudices, imbibed for want of proper care when young,
are doubtless the occasion of many of the weaknesses and inconsistencies
which so much dim the beauty and lessen the service of many,
whom God intends for great instruments in his vineyard.

Well, my mind longs to see, in our well-minded Friends everywhere,
especially the younger sort,
a noble emulation for the welfare and well educating of the youth.
If a number of such Friends, in their different allotments, would, as it were,
shake hands with the world and all its enticing prospects,
seeking and expecting nothing from it but bread and trouble,
and would freely dedicate themselves to the care of the youth,
not limiting themselves to the narrow views of fleshly ties,
nor even to religious denominations,
but looking upon themselves as fathers and brothers of all that want their help,
taking more especial care to make the poor and helpless the first objects of such a care,
not solely of necessity, but of a willing mind, what a blessing might they be,
not only to our youth in particular, but also to mankind in general.
And indeed it seems to me that our principles, which,
in the present corrupt state of the world, seem to prohibit our meddling with offices,
etc, naturally point out to us as a people, rather than others,
to serve God and our country in the education of the youth.
I will acknowledge that it is a situation which
does not appear so desirable as some others,
nor so likely to procure riches, ease, or worldly honour.
But alas!
Alas! what have we to do with these things 1 Shall we desire to be great and rich,
when our Saviour has so plainly declared it a situation so very dangerous;
and that his predominant choice is of the poor of this world`'.`' Is it now a time,
or was it ever a time for the believer,
who eyes and relies upon the promise--is it a time for such to seek for money,
or olive yards, or oxen,
etc.? And although by engaging in the education of the youth we
should be deprived of some of those things so desirable to nature,
which we might better enjoy and accumulate in the way of trade,
and thereby look upon ourselves under affliction,
yet may we not hope that it will be termed for righteousness`' sake,
and therefore should not we have thereat to rejoice, and be exceeding glad,
and even leap for joy?

And I would further say, from years`' experience,
that it is a great mistake to think that the
education of youth is toilsome and disagreeable;
it is indeed not so, except to such who from a desire of gain,
take upon them the care of more children than they ought,
or neglect to bring them into that discipline which, with Divine help,
and proper resolution, is generally not difficult.
I do not know how it is amongst you, but here, any person of tolerable morals,
who can read and write, is esteemed sufficiently qualified for a schoolmaster; when,
indeed, the best and wisest men are but sufficient for so weighty a charoe.

If the governments of this world were influenced by true wisdom,
they would make the proper education of youth their first and special care.
I earnestly desire that our Friends, both here and amongst you, would consider of it,
and hearken inwardly to what the great and common
Father would suggest in this weighty matter.
Many good and necessary works are omitted,
solely because custom has allowed them to be passed over as not necessary,
nor binding upon us; when, if we would give ourselves time to consider them,
divested from custom and prejudice,
we should see them to be weighty and indispensable duties.
But I fear a proposal of this kind would prove to many
as great a trial of the sincerity of their love,
as the instance of the young man that came to Christ.
Many appear to have a love to Christ, and would sell something for his service,
especially if it was to serve him in some elevated and shining sphere;
but to serve Christ in a station generally so little regarded, where the labour of love,
though ever so deep and sincere, is much hid, and often, when the most impartial,
but the more disliked, this is hard for flesh and blood to encounter.

Well, dear friend,
I was not easy without thus laying before thee some part of my concern and prospect.
I apprehend, from my knowledge of thy generosity,
I need make no apology either for the strangeness of the thought,
or the incoherence of the style.

Whether this matter will appear to thee or others in
the weighty and extensive view it does to me,
or not, I must leave, and remain thy friend,

Many sympathize with their brethren amongst you, who suffer for conscience`' sake,
and have their sufferings augmented by being wounded in the house of their friends;
what shall we say, but refer all to the wisdom of that Being,
who best knows by what means to winnow away the chaff,
and purify to himself a peculiar people?
I trust, in and through all these things, the great Name will be exalted,
and the church be more and more evidently built on that which cannot be removed.
Strait is the way to life, and few there be that find it,
is a remark which hath lost no part of its truth and weight by its antiquity.

The account of the promising prospect of the youth amongst you is to
me cause of humble thankfulness to the ever blessed Helper,
who will, in his own way and manner, carry on his own cause,
and make the place of his feet glorious: I fully believe that it is his purpose,
notwithstanding the day is dark and gloomy;
and oh that the natural branches of our vine may
never be plucked away for their unfruitfulness;
but the will of the Lord be done.

I often nearly remember thee and thy situation,
who hath a quicker sense of feeling than many others,
and cannot with indifference behold the temple violated and polluted by contentious,
apostatizing spirits; may healing balm and heavenly help be supplied,
in every needful time.
Farewell, beloved friend, let us remember each other when we can,
and carefully watch to the end.

I am indebted to thee for the affectionate tokens of thy remembrance,
by which I am pleased and profited,
and retain in my mind a very near and just regard for thee and thine;
even that love which many waters cannot quench, or remoteness of place impair;
in the spreading whereof I am often present in spirit with the living among you,
with whom I sympathize, and ardently wish for an eternal memorial,
being well content with, and thankful for,
a share in those probations which are wisely allotted
by our Heavenly Father to his most favoured children,
in this the house of our pilgrimage.
The first-born amongst many brethren, the Son of the Highest, trod this anxious path;
and the disciple ought not to wish to be above his Master.
Dear friend, in this stands our peace and safety, in being baptized with his baptism,
and drinking of his cup, as obedient children, fashioned after his image;
though many secret and obvious scenes may attend, yet in suffering we shall be exalted,
and reign by subjection.

It ever gives me a distinguished pleasure to hear of and from your family;
gratitude for your kind hospitality is one, but not the strongest motive;
there is a similarity in minds which cements a hidden union; wherever this is the case,
the connection is strong and delicate,
because it is founded in that which is divine and permanent.
Thy dear children are often, very often, as fresh in my mind as if present with them;
and I am persuaded they are under His notice who delights to
perpetuate his blessings in the families of his servants,
and transmit from generation to generation his mercy, goodness, and truth;
may this inestimable blessing be precious in their eyes,
and the humbling impressions be properly prized;
so will peace and joy be spread around them,
and the solicitude of their parents relieved by its end being effectually answered.

I am, through mercy,
restored to a better state of health than I once expected I ever should,
though not wholly freed from a weakness in my breast,
the consequence of a too unguarded exertion of my voice:
care is now necessary to attend to every circumstance
which may conduce to the preservation of my health,
so as to continue capable of any service, if any should be required.

I am well pleased with the agreeable accounts of
the service of our European Friends amongst you;
may the Lord make them a blessing to you, and clothe them with wisdom and power.
I hope you will be kindly affectioned to them all,
and administer convenient food in due season, though it may be reproof;
your neglect of this freedom to some of us, to whom it was due,
has not been attended with the best effects.

Whatever my heart is susceptible of, in the time of enlargement,
to the family and my fellow believers, in that I most affectionately salute thee,
thy dear husband, and children.

Warrington, Fifth month 26th, 1759.

The friendship I had the great happiness to contract with thy dear husband and self,
remains as entire and animated as ever;
for an excellent reason it is so--the stream will flow while the fountain supplies it,
and our fountain, I trust, will never fail.
I often am present in spirit with thee, sometimes a companion of thy solitary hours,
and as if I sometimes shared with thee apart in those baptisms which
are necessarily and wisely allotted for the instruction of all states.
A time will come, my dear friend, when we shall with Divine ardour and holy certainty,
close our anthem with this acknowledgment, In wisdom hast thou made all thy works;
until which event attend us,
O may all the days of our pilgrimage be passed in vigilance and filial awe!
It hath pleased Divine Providence to allot me
the dispensation of a tedious indisposition,
which hath held me all winter, and is not wholly removed;
the formation of an abscess in my lungs was very dangerous in the ninth month last,
and continued so for some time; released from that complaint,
I enjoyed a month`'s half health, and was seized with something like the gout,
which quickly increased to a violent degree.
I got relief, but remain weak, and scarcely able to walk the streets,
my limbs being much debilitated; yet, as moderate exercise is very serviceable to me,
I intend setting out tomorrow for our approaching yearly meeting in London.

This humbling baptism of long sickness hath instructed me,
and I earnestly pray it may be to refine me: the heavens were as brass,
and the earth as iron;
and I thought the water floods and terrors of the great deep came up into my soul;
all comfort seemed removed--nay, the hope of salvation, at times, well nigh failed me.
But though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death,
the secret invincible Arm was underneath, when I durst not hope it,
and brought me again to praise him in the land of the living.
May a humble sense of his dealings, who is glorious throughout all his name,
remain my covering all his days.

I have lately been favoured with the company of dear John Haslam,
on his way to visit the church in Ireland.
His bodily strength is as well as can be expected, respecting that which must decay;
his spiritual strength, as well as could be desired;
and all who have spiritual sense to discern with,
(except himself,) see him very strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,
but the same humble, diffident, lamb-like Christian he ever was,
though I think him more deep in heavenly mysteries than ever.
Thy faithful friend,

[.signed-section-context-open]
Warrington, Seventh month 18th, 1759.

There is a union and converse of spirit whose language
is too diffusive and tender to be thrown upon paper,
in which communion, the ground of which is pure, I wish our increase and stability;
and it is a prayer not unattended with faith,
that preservation to the end may be our lot, though many exercising scenes, and painful,
unaccompanied steps, through solitary paths, may be assigned,
in a wisdom too great for us to comprehend.

My dear sister, let us endeavour to possess our souls in patience, and hope in quietness;
hereby an equanimity is attainable,
that preserves all our spiritual and natural faculties clear and useful,
neither dejecting into too deep distress, nor exalting into insecure tranquillity,
nor yet relaxing the mind into forgetfulness of what is ever proper to attend to.
How safe are the followers of Wisdom,
who causeth those who love her to inherit substance,
and leadeth them in the midst of the paths of judgment.

I am humbly thankful to the Author of all good,
for the return of my health to a comfortable degree,
and for the renewal of his gracious presence, for best health.
It is a crowning mercy when he vouchsafes to favour with the light of his countenance,
and give, if but an imperfect, yet real, glimpse of the seal of the covenant;
may it be fresh upon us, in time and in eternity.

I am ready to hope the present situation of my mind is not remote from good,
I feel such a degree of love for heaven, for those that dwell therein,
and for those that are carefully seeking after an habitation there.
As I mused this evening, the fire burned, and warmed me, and I felt thee, I think,
(after the Author of good,) near, if not quite uppermost in my remembrance; and,
though such language as I am capable of cannot point out the outlines of a friendship,
though founded in nature, yet refined and strengthened by grace, and rendered strong,
if I do not presume too much for myself, by a similarity of minds;
yet I am most free and easy to tell thee I remember thee in
that love which is not liable to change or decay,
and renew the expression of my wishes for thy sure blessing every way.
For my own part, I am quiet, I think not stupid; I am often very poor,
but I remember Him who fasted forty days.
I at times meet with hidden sorrow,
but I call to mind that fair weather comes out of the north;
and if the present light afflictions have their proper effect,
they will work for us an eternal weight of glory.
A superficial view of my state may induce many to think
I am remote from the vales of sorrow and disquietude;
but I often tread the solemn, lonely path of secret mourning; I do not complain,
I dare not, I ought not, for my Father who is in heaven, is wise, righteous, and good.
O, may he renew my confidence in him, and be my refuge in the hour of need!

I am not out of love with myself, my state, or the world;
I have at times an evidence renewed which makes it
comfortable to meet my God in the cool of the evening,
and that he cares for me;
no uneasy disappointment disturbs my mind respecting temporal matters;
I wish to climb above them, into the secret place of the Most High,
and I feel his outstretched arm is near for the glorious purpose.

Farewell, my friend and companion in the solitary, safe way to peace;
may we eye our guide, and follow him with diligence, and he will not fail us;
let us not fly away on the wings of levity and folly,
nor derogate from the rectitude of his allotments, by the glooms of nature.
Remember me affectionately; tell me so when thou can,
and be assured of my most affectionate regard from every motive.

Through the gracious help of Providence,
I have to send thee the account of my arrival here in good health.
Yesterday and this day we have had two meetings here, very large,
especially this afternoon, which we were obliged to hold upon the sea-shore,
no place being large enough for the reception of the people,
who were above three thousand, the country coming in for many miles round;
the Lord of sure mercies was graciously near, and magnified his own name and Truth;
to him be the praise of his own works, for they only can praise him.

My mind is comforted in being here, being assured I am in my place,
and my health is much confirmed; I hope to use every prudent precaution to preserve it,
though the weight of the service lays much upon me,
there being none in the ministry but myself, besides a few of the members of the meeting.
I long much to hear from thee.
I hope to be at Plymouth on fifth-day evening next, at Exeter on first-day,
and Bristol on fourth.

Warrington, Eleventh month 3rd, 1759.

Since my return home, I have been favoured with an acceptable letter from thee,
and should have made several epistolary visits to thee,
had every other circumstance been as favourable as my inclination,
and sincere desire for thy preservation and stability in the best things.
It is very acceptable to hear and feel that He who hath put forth goes before thee,
and attends graciously with never-failing help.
I am under an awful obligation to acknowledge his bounty and condescension,
in supporting in my late laborious engagement, and we have both the greatest reason.
He hath preserved us by the right hand of his power, and distinguished humility,
obedience, and watchful fear is our alone place of safety; may we abide therein,
that with unimpaired strength we may run our race and finish our course.
And, dear friend,
it hath often been the cause of humiliation and sorrow to me
to behold the unprofited state in which many remain,
who hear the Truth with gladness, but lay not hold, fast hold, on eternal life;
the ministry is to such a pleasant sound, but for want of rooting,
their beauty is momentary, and succeeded by withering.
I fear that island, as well as this, has too many of that superficial sort,
even amongst those who think themselves to be something,
and judge of their advance in life by their pleasures in hearing and talking.
There is a remnant, with whom my soul is united in the heavenly covenant;
these have one Father and head, and unto him is their eye directed;
they know no man after the flesh,
nor have trust in any thing short of the renewings of the Holy Ghost;
and they well know nothing else can keep them
steadfast and immovable in these degenerate days.
My mind will be frequently with the seed in the approaching solemnity,
with such strength of desire as I may be favoured with for the exaltation of the pure,
holy Truth.
May all the labourers in the Lord`'s service be clothed with the humility, meekness,
wisdom, and strength of the Lamb; this will be victorious at last, when the zeal, will,
and wrath of man must utterly fail.

Thy complaint of the state of the church in your parts is sorrowful,
and it is much more so when the cultivation of the
heavenly Hand hath been more abundantly known,
and the former and latter rain have abundantly descended,
and I think this hath been the case of this county in a remarkable degree.

I mean not the favours conveyed through the channel of my labours,
but the many heavenly visitations immediately, and through others.
The secret love of the world hath prevailed to weaken
many hands the Lord would have made strong for himself;
whereby the testimony is deserted and the cords slackened, immoral practices connived at,
and very few, scarcely any, who dare stand in the gap.
Many think better of us than we merit,
and some think I may be strengthened much by a worthy assistant, who seems, at London,
clothed with zeal, but is at home my greatest burden.
May our minds, dear friend, cleave to the Preserver of men,
that thereby strength may be renewed simply to suffer,
and simply to stand in the counsel of God; then how, where, and what we are,
will be perfectly right.
The Lord direct thy steps in wisdom, prudence and zeal.

Warrington, Eleventh month 13th, 1759.

Though neither my inclination nor capacity allow my
engagements to be in some respects so arduous as thine,
yet they are as many and as laborious as my strength of body and mind are equal to,
and frequently so encumbering as to prevent my conversing with such Friends as the
warmth of an affectionate heart would frequently recall to my near remembrance.
Thyself and dear wife, from the motives of gratitude, union of spirit,
and similarity of sentiment, are often present with me,
and that friendship is not at all impaired which united us when together, and I hope,
according to your Indian phrase, "`The chain may be often brightened.`"
And, dear Israel, thou well knowest what it is that unites to all the living,
and preserves in the unity of the one Spirit, even that leaven of the kingdom, which,
by a silent, solemn, and efficacious energy, begets into the Divine nature,
and makes the whole lump congenial with itself and with the family.
It is uniform in its operation, ever productive of one glorious end,
though the objects on which it operates may be various.
It animates the gloomy, regulates the unstable,
and causes the volatility of the more vivacious to subside, and directs them to, and in,
their respective services.

When I see the different tempers of men,
I am confirmed in a strong assurance that in wisdom the Lord hath made them all,
and that in the abundance of his mercy and truth he would direct them to his glory,
and sanctify to his use and our comfort.
May we be so happy as to be completely his workmanship, which is beautiful,
and the praise of the whole earth.
I feel so great occasion for a jealousy over myself,
and am so often humbled by one thorn or another, that I may, perhaps, from that feeling,
be giving away my own bread to one that has less need of it than myself.
But my soul is humbled within me, to crave inward establishment in the holy,
hidden life of the Lamb,
and that thence the complete similitude of the King`'s sons may be our happy experience.
My situation is such as to exclude boasting and guard against despondency;
and though I pass through various dispensations, their end I consider is one,
and that is good, though the path to it may at times lie through the shadow of death;
yet this evidence I have, and I hope never to lose, my daily desire and prayer is,
in the language of the psalmist, "`Let my heart be sound in thy statutes.`"
As to the state of the church, I cannot say much;
I think she is going into the wilderness,
to the place her husband hath prepared for her there;
she is seldom visible about the dwellings of her nominal professors;
many make use of her name for fraudulent purposes and lucrative views,
the filthy lucre of preeminence.
I know them by this mark --they aspire to be great, and not, by becoming little,
and the servants of all, patient toward all men.
They say they are zealous, some think them so, but where the eye is not single,
no zeal can be there that is of the right sort.

My business is not much in public affairs.
Our nation is intoxicated with success.
I cannot rejoice with their joy.
Methinks there is yet behind the veil something to teach us righteousness.
The commotions of this present day have not that instructive effect on the people.
May the great Lord of heaven and earth magnify his own name and arm.
I believe He will do it, and that the day is near at hand,
that he will work his wonderful work.
Oh that our names may be written in his book, enrolled in his army;
so shall the strength of salvation and protection be our portion.
Dear friend, all other vision is a dream, and all labour fruitless or worse,
that hath not some tendency to promote this establishment.
We are hastening fast through the scenes of time, and everlasting certainty is at hand.
Oh, therefore,
let our fervour be directed to that substance the wise of all ages have chosen,
and leave the bustles of obstructing things, to sit at the feet of the Prince of Peace.

My love is to thy dear spouse; I love the remembrance of her:
I wish I were rich in spiritual wealth,
I would freely communicate some to her if I could,
though she knows the way to the place where all treasure is hid,
and also who enables to partake thereof.
I have every branch of thy family fresh in my affectionate regard,
and salute them with unfeigned love;
may the riches of all the righteous generations become their inheritance forever.
I by no means forget poor afflicted Mary Jordan;
she has the just sympathy of my heart that feels for her, and what is infinitely better,
the tender mercy of our Father who is in heaven,
an appellation given to him from the heights and from the depths.
Various are the snares attendant on unguarded health;
the steps of youth are in slippery places; our stay is momentary,
and more safe in the house of mourning than in the house of mirth.

As to my situation, it hath either been a scene of labour abroad, or sickness at home:
I have been on the brink of the grave twice last winter.
This, seems to promise better health, and, perhaps, a quiet rest at home.
However it be, I am content,
in humble confidence in the sure Helper of all who love and fear him.
I will conclude with the assurance of sincere affection for you all,
in that which remains through all the changes of time.

Warrington, Twelfth month 2nd. 1759.

The emotions of pure friendship, which often warm my mind towards thee,
render thy welfare and prosperity most desirable,
and fill my mind with unfeigned sympathy in which I tenderly salute thee.
From thine of 23rd of eighth month,
I find those evidences of life which are incontestable, even want and anxiety;
I wish they may ever continue directed towards the everlasting Supplier,
who will in his own time lead to Rehoboth,
where all sufficiency reveals itself to the humble, sincere soul.
It is infinitely preferable to that state of death, and consequently insensibility,
which many rejoice in as their principal good.
We are under the continual notice of a merciful Father, who sees and pities us;
when our backslidings correct us, he mitigates the severity due,
and turns even our weaknesses into the means of renewing strength,
and renews great occasion to hope all things shall work together for wood.
I often consider the situation of your province in this sifting day,
in which a separation is made between the true-hearted followers of Christ,
though in the way of the cross, and those whose building is upon the sand,
in the spirit and temper of an unstable world.
The suffering of the true seed is great, and the wormwood bitter.
These things are permitted,
and may be the introduction to greater winnowing and exercise;
but the Lamb and his followers will be finally victorious.
May the righteous seed therefore be patient, and hope to the end,
for faithful is He who hath called into this day of buffeting.

Our worthy friend Joseph White is about Durham.
His service is not merely very acceptable, but solidly beneficial;
I have known none more eminently favoured with the wisdom and authority of Truth.
His health is not fully confirmed, though he is able to travel diligently.

Farewell, my dear friend;
may the hand which hath supported in many concealed and obvious trials,
and encouraged to hope in his salvation, be reverently waited for.
If we, on our part, remember and follow as we ought, our Rock will not sell us,
nor ever fail; the Lord our righteousness will make way for us,
and exalt our drooping heads in his own time.
