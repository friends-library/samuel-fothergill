== Chapter VIII.

The year 1754 is memorable in the life of Samuel Fothergill,
as being that in which he left his native land to engage in the long and
laborious service of a religious visit to the provinces of North America.

The unfoldings upon his mind of this important duty,
and the steps which he took that he might rightly engage in the performance of it,
are well described in the following extract from his journal.
His care to observe good order,
and his earnest desire to obtain and proceed
with the unity and concurrence of his friends,
are well worthy of note.

"`It having been weightily upon my mind, from the motion of the Word of Life,
to pay a religious visit to the church of Christ in the plantations of North America;
after near ten years from the first opening thereof, and many painful tossings,
with fear on one hand of running unsent, and on the other,
a reverent care not to slight the requirings of that Holy
Being who has a right to command in earth as well as in heaven,
I found it clearly opened when was the proper time,
and a disposition of spirit was given me to acquiesce with Truth`'s requirings,
and endeavour to act honestly thereto.

"`In pursuance whereof,
having mentioned my concern to several weighty brethren and sisters,
and having their concurrent sense of my being rightly called to that service,
I acquainted our Friends at the preparative meeting at Penketh,
and monthly meeting for Hardshaw, held at Warrington in the fourth month 1754,
who gave me a certificate of their concurrence,
and sense of Truth`'s requiring in this weighty undertaking.
I also laid my concern before our quarterly meeting at Lancaster, the same month,
which endorsed my certificate, and signed it by many Friends.
I also found my mind engaged to acquaint Friends at the
yearly meeting of ministering Friends in London,
who also testified their approbation by a certificate,
signed by many brethren and sisters.
These particular steps I found it my duty to take,
in order to obtain the concurrence or counsel of Friends, both for example`'s sake,
and the mutual unity of the brotherhood, which in low times,
hath been strength and encouragement to my drooping spirit.

"`I left Warrington the 2nd of eighth month, 1754: my dear wife, with some others,
accompanied me to Leek, where we parted on the 3rd, and I came to London,
being met at Albans by my sister, on the 5th, and stayed in London until the 9th,
when dear John Churchman and myself, accompanied by many Friends, went down to Gravesend.

"`Eighth month 10th, 1754.--Went on board the Caroline, Stephen Mesnard, commander; had,
with many Friends who went on board, a precious opportunity,
in the humbling sense of Divine regard.
We returned to Gravesend to dine; and afterwards parted from our dear friends,
and went on board the ship.
Fell down the river, and were detained in the Downs and the Channel until the 17th,
when we lost the sight of land, and pursued our voyage.

"`Had a comfortable passage,
in which time we always kept up--though only two,--our religious meetings,
and the Lord of all mercies was often and mercifully near to our comfort.

"`Ninth month 23rd.--We first discovered the Capes of Delaware river,
and took in a pilot; being favoured with a good wind,
we came one hundred and twenty miles up the river, and cast anchor above Wilmington.

"`24th.--Went ashore, and hired horses to Wilmington,
where we were very kindly received by William and Elizabeth Shipley,
Immediately after our arrival, William Brown and Joshua Dixon came in,
who were just landed, though they sailed three weeks before us.
Dear John Churchman went home that evening, and William Brown, Joshua Dixon, and myself,
went up that evening to Philadelphia and Schuylkill, I lodged at Israel Pemberton`'s,
where I met a kind reception.`"

The journal is kept thus minutely only for a few days after he landed in America;
but he continued daily to record in it the places he visited,
and the meetings which he attended, with occasional brief notices of some of them,
as a "`favoured meeting`"--"`meeting large and well`"--"`a low time,`" etc.

His feelings, and the various exercises of his mind, his progress and travels,
are much developed in the correspondence which follows.

Opposite Margate, First-day morning, Eighth month 11th, 1754.

As our pilot is likely to leave us very soon,
I embrace the opportunity of sending this on shore by him,
to let you know I am well and easy in spirit and body.
The strong ties of affection subsisting between us,
rendered it very hard for me to tear myself away from you;
but I accept it as a mark of the heavenly Father`'s regard,
and an evidence that I am not out of my place,
that my mind peaceably centres in Him whose hand I feel in the service before me;
and have much left behind me every tie that might unavailingly distress my mind.

I beg each of us may ever seek that centre of real quiet,
which can never be destroyed by any commotions by sea or land.

My near and affectionate salutation is to you both,
and my prayers are for your preservation, as for my own.

Philadelphia, Ninth month 26th, 1754.

I embrace this early opportunity of acquainting thee with my safe arrival here,
after a very agreeable passage of six weeks and three days from London.
I have had my health at sea remarkably well, and not an hour sick the whole passage;
my appetite and rest in general as well as on land; highly favoured with the agreeable,
profitable company of dear John Churchman, and the whole cabin to ourselves;
and what is still more valuable,
the countenance of our heavenly Father often beheld to our comfort: with a grateful,
humble spirit, I ascribe thanksgiving and praise to the Fountain of mercies,
ancient and new.

On third-day, the 24th instant, we landed about thirty miles below this city,
being prevented from coming up by contrary wind,
and went ashore near Elizabeth Shipley`'s, where we met with a kind reception,
and in half an hour were agreeably surprised to see
William Brown and Joshua Dixon come into the house;
they sailed three weeks before us, and we arrived before them,--a joyful,
humbling meeting it was.
After we had refreshed ourselves, John Churchman left us,
proposing to reach home that night, and we came up to this city.

I am, with a heart replenished with thankfulness to the Author of all our mercies,
and in the most affectionate nearness to thee,
with the salutation of love to all relations and friends,
thine in the bonds of continued affection,

I earnestly crave of our heavenly Protector that
his holy arm may surround and support us both;
may keep thee in quiet resignation to his will in the present trial,
and in every respect help to live to his own praise, and thy solid comfort:
and I question not but it will be so, as he is properly and reverently sought to.
I know and sensibly feel thy sympathy is strongly with me in my present allotment,
and I have, with an awfully humbled soul,
to acknowledge His living power and mighty arm have been
sensibly and plentifully with me since my arrival here,
having been at six meetings in this place,
several of which have truly been memorably to my own
encouragement to look to him who is all-sufficient.

The meetings are exceedingly large, and all sorts and ranks of people flock to them,
and the mighty Name is deservedly exalted.
In the midst of this favour I rejoice with trembling,
and in full expectation of my having an approaching humbling time,
wherein I may be proved with want and poverty; I am thoroughly resigned, I hope,
to suffer as well as to abound Friends here treat me with very great affection,
on dear father`'s account,
and some resemblance in person and ministry has induced
divers to think they would have known me to be his son,
if they had not known of my arrival.
Oh, that I may be so conducted as to walk in his footsteps,
and dishonour neither his name, nor the cause of Truth.

And although every affectionate sentiment towards thee,
and near union to friends and relations thereaway, strongly subsist with me,
yet I have a perfect quiet and weanedness from all at home,
which I esteem a singular mercy;
my soul is bound to the testimony and seed of God in these parts.

Philadelphia, Tenth month 3rd, 1754.

I have now to inform thee my health is preserved beyond expectation, and the climate,
though it has been much hotter than any of our summers, has not been intolerable;
the greatest inconvenience I find is the number of mosquitos, a little venomous fly,
that have, within these few nights, severely handled me,
and so swelled my hands as to render it not easy to write; a feverish heat has attended,
but I am carefully and affectionately nursed by my very kind landlady.

I hitherto have cause of thankfulness and awful worship before the Almighty,
for his help in enabling me quietly to bear a
separation from what is to me inexpressibly dear,
and even without a wish about any, but for their happiness, which often occurs.
I feel my soul bound to the testimony and cause of Truth as my proper business;
no insensibility attends my mind, or decay of pure affection; it is cheerfully fresh,
and livingly revived; but I have been led into a service,
by a hand at whose dispensation I dare not repine,
and who is the all-sufficient and only stay for all our states,
and who has been pleased to favour, in condescension not to be enough admired,
and claims the most humble returns.

I have been at seven meetings in this city,
some of which have been times of memorable favour to my soul,
and I believe a fresh visitation of gracious help to some here,
that I have cause of secret ease of mind in giving up to the service.
Yet am I sensible, low baptizing times must be met with,
and I may probably travel many days in the strength of that bread already received;
but in this also I desire to be contented; it was the lot of the all-perfect One,
and of his faithful.
I beg preservation from everything which might exclude me from his holy table;
and let His will be done who is ever worthy.

Dear sister, may thy mind be stayed upon that which is immovable, which, though one,
is omnipresent, our mutual rejoicing in spirit, though absent in body,
and I am afresh assured is near us both for our good:
this time of absence will gradually wear away;
and I hope to be restored in the due time to the enjoyment of that
society and company which is at this time fresh in my remembrance,
and dear to my life.

It is in a degree of that love that makes the friends of Truth near to each other,
in a spiritual relation, though personally unacquainted, that I at this time salute thee;
and having oft-times experienced a real pleasure in sympathizing with my friends,
whether in joy or sorrow, it is a disposition of mind I desire to retain,
as it bears a near resemblance to that blessed example
which it is our duty and greatest interest to follow,
and justly due to each other as His disciples.
In a sense of this regard and sympathy,
I have thought of thee in this time of separation from so valuable a companion,
for the work`'s sake whereunto he is called, and so eminently qualified; and doubt not,
dear friend,
but the present dispensation will be made easy to a person of thy religious experience,
by a large share of that peace which is the effect of righteousness,
and in partaking of that blessing,
which I hope and trust will attend the labours
of thy dear husband in this part of the world.
And may we,
who have been frequently visited with tokens of the Divine regard in this respect,
walk worthy of so great mercy and favour,
by bringing forth fruits agreeable to the abundant labour bestowed upon us.
Well may it be said of us, as of old, We, as a people,
above all the families of the earth, have been distinguished,
by the inestimable blessing of a living and powerful ministry;
the Lord grant that the present generation may
experience the happy effects of these gracious calls,
thoroughly to awaken them to a humble and circumspect walking with him;
and as thy beloved husband is peculiarly instrumental in this great and honourable work,
I believe I may venture to say, he meets with a pleasing reception by all,
and I am sure by us,
who are favoured with his acquaintance and agreeable company at our house.

After our quarterly meeting, the beginning of next month, he, perhaps,
will make but a short stay amongst us,
the season of the year being the most suitable for a longer journey to the southward,
to which I perceive he is at present led,
and am not without thoughts that my dear husband may bear him company,
if he can contract his affairs into a compass suitable to leave;
and though it is a considerable trial to be deprived of the
company of an agreeable companion and indulgent husband,
it is a circumstance which hath heretofore frequently fallen to my lot, in which,
at times,
I have happily experienced that the exercise of patience and
resignation hath been attended with a suitable reward.

Philadelphia, Tenth month 31st, 1754.

I can at once inform thee I am well, every way well;
glory and praise forever be ascribed to the inexhaustible spring of all mercies,
who has sustained hitherto beyond my utmost hopes,
and enabled me to travel closely and labour faithfully, in his work and service.
I have finished, as far as I see at present, my visit to the eastern shore of Maryland,
and visited a small meeting in Virginia, which consisted but of one family; but,
as I understood they kept up a meeting constantly, I could not leave it,
though it cost me one hundred and eighty miles ride.
I have been about twenty-five days out of this place,
and travelled about six hundred and fifty miles,
and am better in health than when I left it; the weather generally pleasant,
the roads very good,
our accommodations such as many better Friends have been content with,
and I am thoroughly so.
I came back to this city, having some concern to attend the quarterly meeting;
after that I hope to have everything ready for my long journey.
I expect it will be five or six months before I
can either hear from or write again to thee.
Israel Pemberton proposes to accompany me the greatest part of my southern journey.

I esteem it a mercy that claims my deepest gratitude,
that I am so much favoured in every respect;
and my soul is bowed in reverence to the Author of true help, for the aid granted,
and I hope ever to live mindful of it.
I met dear Mary Peisley here, and we were together this day at the week-day meeting,
which was very large,
and we were both helped to labour in the wisdom and authority of Christ our head,
to his own honour and our great peace.

I want not affectionate remembrance of my near and dear relations,
but have not opportunity at present of writing, nor doth necessity require it;
if they live in heart to the heavenly Father,
our sympathy and union one with another will stand immovable,
in that which absence cannot impair nor many waters quench;
which will be our joy and rejoicing one in and with another;
though outward expressions may fail,
yet no mistrust of neglect or forgetfulness will take place.
But if this hidden root of the saints`' fellowship be overlooked,
a decay of true union will gradually ensue,
and alienation of heart from the family and its Holy head will take place.
My soul fervently begs all may be quickened to diligence, in this their day,
to do their own business faithfully in the heavenly plantation;
to the rooting out hurtful things,
which I am sure will grow and spread in the unguarded heart,
which has not a hedge about it, nor seeks the descending of holy rain, for quickening,
enlivening help; but is absent from its proper, safe habitation in the Truth,
abroad in the world, and its pursuits and evil spirit.
Such will suffer loss, and be in danger of being so lamentably covered with briars,
thorns, and weeds, as to be altogether unlike that garden enclosed,
wherein the Spouse often condescends to walk, and makes it as Eden.
The salutation of my heart is towards my brethren and sisters that way,
and their families,
with strong desires for all their help and establishment in the truth of God;
for that is our foundation, and sole, safe corner stone to build on.
People may build upon hay and stubble,
and have cause to be ashamed with everlasting shame and disappointment.
For let us awfully consider, what many are desirous to forget,
a day of trial hastens apace upon all, in their particular capacity; and happy they,
and they only, who have dug to Christ the rock,
and in faithful obedience been built up by him, in and upon himself.
When dismay shall overtake the stout-hearted,
and woe and distress those who have been falsely at ease in Zion,
and a terrible day come upon the forgetful and negligent,
those honestly concerned and diligent labourers in their respective lots in the heritage,
will have to rejoice in the abundant experience of Divine protection,
and receive the end of their faith, even the salvation of their souls.
The overflowing of affectionate remembrance has, unawares,
led my pen forward towards my near and dear relations with their families,
and I leave thee to thy liberty either to keep
or spread amongst them what I have written.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Philadelphia, Eleventh month 6th, 1754.

In the freshness of strong natural affection,
and in the renewedness of that love which is abundantly more uniting,
I tenderly salute you; and though far outwardly separated from you,
for the cause and testimony of Truth, and the way of my duty for peace`' sake,
yet are you often present in spirit with me, and I am persuaded, I with you,
in that which is not destroyed or impaired by absence.
I have, through the wonderful condescension of our father`'s God, to inform you,
who are anxiously solicitous about me, that I am well--every way well;
my health better than I have for some time enjoyed in my native country;
and what is to me a deeper cause of reverent dwelling in ashes,
the holy arm of strength is near, to help to live and to labour in the Lord`'s heritage,
so as to know his blessed approbation, which I principally and above all desire,
and in that true and solid peace which is the true riches of the soul.

I worship in heart and spirit towards that heavenly Arm who has led me,
an unworthy creature, into the secret fellowship of his servants,
and given an earnest of the promised inheritance;
who hath graciously passed by manifold transgressions,
called me into some share of his holy service,
and hitherto sustained through many besetments,
regarded the secret seed of sincerity in my heart, and revived my hiddenly pained soul,
even when I had merited an everlasting rejection.
O,
that the sense of his mercy might ever cover and clothe
our spirits to such a degree of humble diligence,
as to excite to a faithful following and service
of him who is ever worthy of fear and obedience.
In this, and this only, we shall rejoice in our lots, every one under his own fig tree,
that has been planted, pruned,
and made fruitful by the cultivation of the right hand of the great Husbandman.

On the 4th of last month, I went towards the eastern shore of Maryland,
to some yearly meetings, which I found my mind drawn towards,
and to visit the meetings of Friends in that part of the province,
and the three lower counties belonging to Pennsylvania;
in which visit I was mercifully often favoured with strength to labour to my comfort,
and true ease of spirit,
being often remarkably opened into the states of
the meetings and individuals where I came;
but alas, the state of the church is very low thereaway, their numbers small,
but their care and zeal for truth in general less than their numbers,
so that I could not avoid a daily pain of heart on their account, whilst with them.
The cause seems to me much in their heads,
and such as ought to be their leaders in precept and examples,
by a contrary conduct are become indeed the tail of the people,
as will ever be the case where people seek to live and grow strong,
and not by heavenly food.

Tomorrow I propose to leave this place,
and go through a course of meetings to the remotest part of Virginia,
amongst some newly settled meetings.
I expect to travel five hundred miles, without much turn out of a direct line.
I salute you nearly and tenderly, and am your affectionate brother,

[.signed-section-signature]
Samuel Fothergill.

--

The intimate friendship and frequent correspondence
maintained by Samuel Fothergill with Israel Pemberton,
his brothers, and others of the family,
demand that some brief account of them should be here inserted.

Their ancestor, Phineas Pemberton, was born near Wigan, in Lancashire, in 1650.
He was an early and active member of Hardshaw monthly meeting, residing then at Bolton,
where he endured much persecution for his faithfulness
in supporting the testimonies of the Society of Friends;
he had also suffered in the same cause whilst an apprentice at Manchester.

In common with many others, who, about that time,
sought a country where they might serve God unmolested,
and enjoy the rights of religious freedom undisturbed by persecution,
he embarked for America in the year 1682, with his wife and his aged father,
having many others of their company, to the number of fifty-two persons in all.
This was about the time of the settlement of Pennsylvania by William Penn;
they landed in that province, and found that he had arrived six days before them.
When they came to the place where the city of Philadelphia now stands,
they could not procure any accommodation for their horses, "`so they spancelled them,
and turned them out into the woods.`"

Phineas bought a tract of land near the river Delaware, where he long resided,
a useful member of society, and filled with reputation several offices in the province.^
footnote:[In 1697 he was a member of the Council, and speaker of the Assembly.]
He died in 1702.

His son Israel was born in 1684.
He was a man of a calm, even, and cheerful disposition,
and his mind improved and enriched with the principles of true religion;
this rendered his whole life an instructive example of the Christian virtues.
He was one of the most considerable merchants of Philadelphia, and was,
for nineteen years successively, a representative for that city in the General Assembly.
He died in 1754, much esteemed and beloved, for his great hospitality,
talents and integrity.

His three sons, Israel, James, and John Pemberton,
were all of them eminent and valuable men in their day,
useful in their respective stations,
and for a long period took an active and prominent part in the concerns of the Society,
as well as in some of the affairs more at large of their native city and province.

In the letters of Samuel Fothergill to them there may be observed,
not only the plain and honest manner in which he
expressed his affectionate feelings for their welfare,
but also the remarkable and clear sense which he had of their respective states,
and of the difficulties to which each of them was exposed by character,
by mental constitution, or other circumstances;
and the peculiar fitness of his affectionate counsel and
exhortations to the three brothers is very striking.

Israel, the eldest, was a man of great powers of mind, of a clear and sound judgment,
yet of a quick and ardent temperament, against which he had often to contend,
but he was enabled to yield in good measure to
the subduing and regulating power of Truth.
He was extensively engaged in commerce, and in benevolent pursuits.
He died in 1779, aged sixty-four.

James, the second son, received a liberal education;
and his parents took care early to instill into the minds of all their
children a regard and reverence for those great principles of Truth,
by which his future life was regulated.
His mother, Rachel Pemberton, watched the early unfoldings of his mind,
and hoped much from the mildness of temper and
steadiness of conduct which he early manifested.
Nor was she disappointed; whilst he often bore decisive testimony,
and particularly when near the close of his long and useful life,
to the deep obligation he had been under for her tender and judicious care.

His intellectual powers were great, and highly cultivated.
Possessed of ample pecuniary means, endowed with a sound judgment,
and influenced by the most enlarged benevolence,
he was ever found ready to devote his powers, his time, and his substance,
to the promotion of the good of his fellow creatures.
Of the public chartered schools of Philadelphia he was early elected an overseer,
and of the hospital and other benevolent institutions, he was a liberal benefactor,
and took an active share in their management.
With his brother Israel,
he was the steady friend and advocate of the oppressed African race,
and of the Indian tribes.
They were both at one period members of the state legislature,
and possessed considerable influence,
which they often exerted on behalf of the latter named people.

He filled with ability and reputation many offices in the religious Society of Friends.
Of the meeting for Sufferings he was a member from its first establishment in 1756,
until, in the yearly meeting of 1808, he publicly resigned his place,
on account of his advanced age and increasing infirmities.

In the year 1777, he, with his two brothers, and seventeen other Friends,
were unjustly seized by the government,
and without being informed what was alleged against them,
were taken from their families and homes,
and sent under a military guard to a distant province,
where they were detained as prisoners several months.

His temperate life, and the evenness and placidity of his temper,
contributed to his length of days, smoothed and softened the decline of life,
and rendered the approach to its final close easy, and almost imperceptible.
He often contemplated with steady attention, and without fear, that solemn period;
and in the second month, 1809, he quietly departed, in the eighty-sixth year of his age.

John Pemberton, the youngest of the three brothers, was a humble, diffident man,
gifted with a meek and quiet spirit:
his fearfulness often led him into deep provings and mental conflicts,
ere he felt sufficient confidence to yield a
full and unreserved obedience to required duty.
To him was given the kind word of encouragement,
whilst his brothers appeared more to require, during their earlier days,
the calming and cautionary counsel of an
experienced fellow traveller and faithful friend,
like Samuel Fothergill.

John Pemberton was well known as a minister;
he travelled extensively in this capacity in his native land,
and three times visited Europe.
He first came over with John Churchman and William Brown,
the former of whom he accompanied through many parts of England, and also into Holland.

His next visit was in 1783, in company with William Matthews.
On their voyage they were taken prisoners, and carried into France.
He had extensive service amongst those not of the same religious profession with himself,
particularly in the north of Scotland.
He spent upwards of six years in diligent labour during this visit,
and returned to America, in 1789.

Finding himself once more engaged in religious concern to visit Europe,
he embarked in 1794, landed in Holland, and proceeded to Pyrmont in Germany, where,
after about four months spent in religious labour, he departed this life,
on the 31st of first month, 1795, aged sixty-seven.

Their mother, Rachel Pemberton, was the daughter of Charles Read,
one of the early settlers of Pennsylvania.
She was indeed as a "`mother in Israel,`" and was
distinguished by her care over her own family,
her sympathy with those under affliction of body or mind,
and her great hospitality and kindness,
particularly to those who were called to travel in the work of the ministry:
to such her house was ever open, both during the life of her husband and afterwards.
She died in 1765, at the age of seventy-four.

Mary Pemberton, the wife of Israel, was also a valuable and experienced elder.
The removal of her husband into exile, in 1777, was a great affliction to her; and,
as she expressed, she believed it would tend to shorten her stay in this world.

She fell into a gradual decay during his absence,
and some time after he was restored to his family,
she thus addressed him:--"`It is now evident to me, my dear, that we must soon part;
we have passed through many deep trials; there is nothing between us but true love,
and great affection; I hope thou wilt be kept in true resignation.
I had some hope of continuing some time longer,
both on thy account and that of our dear grand-daughter;
but I am not solicitous about it, not very solicitous.`"
She peacefully departed this life in the tenth month, 1778, aged seventy-four years.

Opechan, Twelfth month 4th, 1754.

In expectation of thy dear husband`'s being set out to meet me, I address this to thee,
to let thee know where I now am I have, with a reverently bowed spirit,
to inform thee I am well every way.
My health is maintained beyond my hopes; and what is more,
and a deeper cause of gratitude and inward worship to the Most High,
his holy arm is near to sustain in labour, to his own honour, and the help of some.
To his worthy name be all the gain consecrated, for it is his due.

My passage seems through briars and thorns,
and my walking as amongst the tombs of the dead,
a general languor having spread amongst the people; nevertheless, the Lord,
terrible in righteousness, is nigh at hand to conduct forwards,
renewing strong evidence that I am in my proper line.

This consideration, dear friend,
is a fruitful source of comfort in many times of deep wading.
Oh, that we, and each of the family, may fix it in full view, as the mark of the prize.
Satisfied I am, many would have wings given them, that now lie as amongst the pots,
and the Father`'s name become famous amongst the ten thousands of his true Israelites.
My soul salutes thee in the fresh sense of living help revealed near; and begs,
as for myself, immovable perseverance, and increase in faithfulness;
that the residue of hindering things may be fully fanned away,
and we may come up in our lots here, and remain in glorious ones forever.

Curles, upon James`' River, in Virginia, Twelfth month 13th, 1754.

In daily and affectionate remembrance, though far outwardly separated,
for the cause and testimony of the Lord our God,
yet never more livingly and comfortably near in spirit since our first acquaintance;
with all the tender affection and sympathy so tender a relation claims,
yet without repining at my lot, or looking painfully homewards,
being sensible the unchangeable Shepherd is all-sufficient to keep and bless,
wherever or however scattered, if suitable care remains not to scatter from him.

I find something in the climate peculiarly favourable to my constitution.
Have had good travelling weather, and not any severe cold;
some rain swelled the rivers as I came along,
and we were obliged to pass them in small canoes ourselves, and swim our horses;
a circumstance I much dreaded before I left England, but am now reconciled to it,
and many other things that seem like hardships; but I am made perfectly easy,
and the day is sufficient for the evil thereof.
I have hitherto slept under a roof, though sometimes a miserable one,
and nevertheless have been preserved from taking any cold that has been troublesome.
I expect to rest at this place two or three days,
and then to proceed in my visit to the residue of this province, North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia, in which route I cannot avoid some nights in the woods;
but the climate there is very warm,
and even at that time of the year the days pretty long.
In this place, where I am,
this day is two hours and four minutes longer than it is in England,
and I have five hundred and fifty miles almost due south to proceed,
before I can see it my way to turn back again.

The state of the church in this province is low and painful; those advanced in years,
in general, very insensible of true feeling,
or suitable zeal for truth`'s advancement in themselves, their families, or the church.
My passage amongst them has been close, laborious, and, in some places,
I believe strengthened to awake and alarm the careless, to their help,
and the renewing cause of secret worship to the Lord Almighty,
that he has hitherto answered the humble petition of my heart,
not to leave me destitute of His holy presence in this remote and desert land.
And his word has indeed been as a flame of fire, and the house of Esau as stubble;
but it is the most exercising, laborious work I ever was engaged in,
being concerned to visit every small meeting, and many of their families,
and when that is done to collect four or five meetings together, as a general meeting,
to take my leave of them.

This manner of labour requires time, and prevents my getting hastily forwards:
but I came for peace, and must not overrun it;
and the sure Helper and reward of his people is eminently near to help,
to the praise of his mighty name,
and the revival of his plantation amongst the rising generation,
some of whom His blessed hand is upon for good.
I am favoured with the company of a worthy innocent Friend, an elder, from Philadelphia;
his name, Edward Cathrall.
I expect Israel Pemberton here this day, to accompany me southwards,
and then Edward Cathrall returns.
He has travelled with me about twelve hundred miles, and been very serviceable;
and has sometimes, though against my will, stepped in between me and expense.

I am humbly thankful to the all-sufficient Hand,
for the continued evidence of his blessed regard;
and strong hope prevails be will not be unmindful of thee,
and my little concerns at home, but by his blessed Providence make bard things easy,
and enable, with patience, and careful diligence, to act our several parts,
to our comfort in him and one in another.

Curies, upon James`' River, Virginia, Twelfth month 13th, 1754.

I have, through the continued favour of the never-failing Fountain of all good,
to inform you, my health is preserved to my admiration.
I remember not eleven weeks spent for some years with less
interruption of health than those I have spent in these parts;
though various circumstances of hardship have attended, particularly cold lodging,
little better than in the woods, yet have not been affected by any cold,
or found any inconvenience afterwards attending.
I find my bodily strength renewed,
and ability given to undergo seeming hardships with very great ease.
I mention this circumstance of health with a
grateful heart towards him who is Lord of all,
the support of body and soul,
and before whom they ought both to be altars whence the
sacrifice of awful worship should often ascend.

I have, since I wrote last,
visited some meetings which lay remote in the distant back parts of Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and Virginia, having crossed the great river Susquehanna,
about eighty miles west of Philadelphia,
and visited the meetings of Friends along the Blue Mountains,
and thence returned one hundred and thirty miles through a country void of Friends,
into the more inhabited part of this colony.
Have hitherto visited all the settled meetings of Friends in my course,
however small and low, and indeed sorrowful is the state of the Church in these parts.
The same painful stupidity of heart, which has covered the eastern shore of Maryland,
and too many in Pennsylvania, seems here also to spread and benumb the people,
more especially amongst those advancing into, or near old age;
there are some living young people amongst them,
but the crooked foot-steps of the old professors, in part,
and the lethargy of those more morally clean,
seem to threaten the utter extirpation of the
profession from various parts of this province.
I have been led into very close and laborious work amongst them,
in their meetings and in their families, and to visit particulars,
to my own secret ease and comfort in the discharge of my duty,
though through the hardest labour that I ever yet met with in public and private.
But the strong support of ever blessed Help has been very wonderfully near,
and has answered the petition that has often arisen from my soul,
deeply and anxiously bowed,
that he would not leave me destitute of his strength and help in a remote land,
but accompany and lead me in every part of my passage, that though separated from many,
near and dear to my life, amongst the nearest whereof I rank you,
I might not be separated from the holy Presence,
or unacquainted with the renewal thereof every day.
And it is with a heart at this time covered with reverence, I have to acknowledge,
he hath not failed to help me to labour faithfully to some service in divers places,
to the awakening and the help of some on their way,
and the comfort of the scattered remnant of the true Israelites.

Some of the younger class seem under the visitation of the blessed planting Hand,
to whom my heart has been drawn with lively encouragement to hold on their way,
and though rejected by their natural parents,
with respect to any religious oversight and help,
the eye of the Father of the whole family both in heaven and earth, seems over them.
May their eye be unto him, for,
alas! all instrumental assistance seems cut off from their earth.
I am obliged for peace`' sake, after I have visited three or four meetings,
to collect them together, to take my leave of them, and though it makes my passage slow,
yet it brings peace, and that I came for, and would gladly bring with me,
if ever I revisit my native land.

It is not unlikely but the rumour of some damage
done in the back parts of South Carolina,
by the Indians, has before this, reached England, and may give some uneasy apprehensions.
I had an opportunity of conversing with a person lately returned from that neighbourhood,
who informed me that the bodies of sixteen English were found murdered,
and nine were missing, who, being principally women,
were supposed to be carried into captivity.
By what Indians the act was committed, is only conjecture;
some northern Indians were seen to march through
the back settlements of Virginia and Maryland.
It is generally thought the English were settling themselves very
fast on a piece of fine hunting land belonging to the Indians,
without giving them satisfaction for it, and had been warned off by them,
but disregarding it, received this severe token of Indian displeasure.
It is remote from the settlement of Friends, and far from my route.

Curles, upon James`' River, in Virginia, Twelfth month 14th, 1754.

Thou hast for some weeks been the frequent companion of my thoughts,
with true nearness and strong regard for thee, and desires for thy safety,
and progress on thy way toward Zion,
and I found this evening an openness of heart to write
to thee a salutation of true brotherly kindness,
to encourage and caution for thy help;
for though my house may not have been so with God as that of some others,
I am not void of experience in the way to New Jerusalem.
I consecrate the gain to God, and dedicate my strength and labour to his service,
and the help of my fellow travellers.
Convinced I am, dear friend,
the Lord Almighty has given thee a name in his holy household,
and consecrated thee in measure to his service.

What lives upon my heart towards thee is:
Keep with diligence the earnest of adoption upon thy own spirit; seek, seek incessantly,
to know the inscription and mark of the family clear and evident upon thee.
It is at times written and imprinted in characters so evident, that ourselves,
and even by-standers, may easily perceive it; this affluence, in an unguarded heart,
produces ease and relaxation of spirit; then is the time Lucifer arises,
and whispers to the soul that dangerous doctrine--Once in grace, ever in grace; and,
Soul, take thy rest; the Lord thy God hath dealt bountifully with thee.
By this means daily care for living bread ceases,
and the remembrance of former bread becomes the sole sustenance of the soul,
and even that in process of time becomes less cared for,
another support having been chosen.
Under the law, many animals were deemed clean who chewed the cud;
but when the victuals have been received in gross, and by the power of revulsion,
brought a second time upon the palate, and chewed, they turn to nourishment,
but are never again to be eaten as food, but fresh must be sought for,
or death soon ensues.
Oh! therefore, cleave to the Feeder of his people; receive what he hands forth;
there is a blessing in it, though it be the bread and water of affliction; low,
painful times are often strongly and blessedly helpful,
and produce a careful search and holy inquiry.
If the precious piece of money be lost, to sweep the house clean, by the searching power,
has often, nay always, been attended with success,
as the only method of finding it again.
In these purified hearts, the word of the Lord God will grow,
and the plant of renown will shoot vigorously, and spread over the wall,
and the branches thereof spread to the ministry of the Word to others.

That lamentable dwarfishness which attends some, is, I am persuaded,
much owing to the want of proper cultivation, and deep labour for spiritual sonship;
for the Lord, our holy head, would have his children resemble himself in beauty,
and their faces like those of the sons of princes of the immortal family.
His voice is heard distinctly--the cry--the what--the
when--are all intelligible to these souls;
their ears are quick of understanding, and their hearts prompt to knowledge.
If heavenly favour be their covering, their safe dwelling is in ashes;
if tossing and low times attend, the Lord is the stability of their salvation;
if snares and temptations attend, they hear the ancient call, "`Arise, my love,
my fair one, and come away.`"
Oh my friend, beloved, in and for the Truth,
that thy lot may be in this safe enclosure of the walls of salvation,
and I am satisfied in heart that the Lord would
make thee an instrument of good in his hand.
Do thou cleave in soul to him, and if he should put thee seemingly up,
and lay by from service in public, quietly bear the dispensation of his providence;
awake not thy beloved until he please.
The Lord of all mercy preserve thee chaste to himself;
guard thee from incumbrances of every kind,
that he alone may be the object in thy view--thy morning light, and evening song.
Amen, Amen saith my soul, for thee, myself, and all his visited, the world over.

I have travelled very closely, being preserved in my health admirably.
I have not been on shore twelve weeks but have travelled above twelve hundred miles,
and have had near seventy public meetings.
A lively remnant remains in this land, principally of the rising generation,
and advancing towards middle life; many of the elders are dead, and some,
though alive in the body, are dead to God in the sense of Truth.
I have often been deeply baptized into distress and suffering on their account,
but with a soul covered with deep reverence before all-sufficient Help.
I have to say his powerful hand has been wonderfully made bare,
and his word has been as a fire in the Mount of Esau,
dreadfully alarming to the forgetful and obdurate;
holy balsam to the wounded has been near; remember it, O my soul, with trembling!

Accept, dear friend, this salutation in good part;
it is the language of a soul solicitous in a strong, secret manner, for thy welfare.

Warrington, First month 12th, 1755.

It gave both me and thy friends great satisfaction to
hear of thy safe arrival and good health,
and of the regard of heavenly protection and help,
and thy evidence of peace was more than all; indeed,
I did not doubt but Divine Providence,
who was pleased to call thee from thy native land in his service, would be near to thee,
and be thy support and strength in every needful time.
My spirit is often with thee,
and my soul often bows in reverent thankfulness to the Fountain of all our mercies,
on thy account, and likewise on my own; having with humble thankfulness to say,
he has helped me hitherto, and hath renewed my strength.
He has, at times, lifted up his countenance upon me,
and replenished my soul with his goodness, so that I have no cause to murmur or repine,
nor ever have since our separation;
being made sensible that it was the will of Providence;
and he has been pleased to endow me with strength freely to resign thee,
believing that he that called thee from me,
could in his own time restore thee to me again,
and so has he been pleased to stay my mind on him.
I have had great peace of mind,
and a secret belief that he would be thy guide and support,
and conduct thee safely on thy journey.

Be not in haste, wherever thou comes;
do not let any place slip that thou mayest have the least glimpse of service in,
be it ever so small, or whether in meetings or families; deliberate and wait,
to know whether there be not something required, and if thou find anything left short,
where thou hast been, it is better to return to the place and finish the work.
I hope and believe Providence will be with thee, and be thy guide.

Charleston, South Carolina, Second month 13th, 1755.

Since I came from Wain-oak,
I have visited all the residue of Virginia and North Carolina,
and late last night arrived here, and have had a meeting here this day,
amongst a poor miserable handful of professors,
and believe I must visit all their families before I can easily leave the place.
I expect to be in Georgia, one hundred and fifty miles south of this place,
some time next week, and then return northwards, eight hundred miles, upon a line,
without much stop, except seven meetings which I left as I came southwards.

The winter hereaway has been remarkably pleasant;
the principal inconvenience has been the heats we have met with;
sometimes in the last month ourselves and horses were obliged
to lay by for some hours in the middle of the day,
to avoid the excessive heats.
On the 29th of last month,
we were overtaken in the evening by a violent storm of thunder, lightning, and rain,
and were lost in the woods.
With much difficulty we got a fire made,
and stood round it in the most violent rain until almost midnight,
when some dogs at a plantation directed us to it, by their barking at our fire,
and the howling of the wolves about us.

On the 2nd instant, after a ride of fifty miles,
we were obliged to lie in the woods all night,
and though the scene was unusual and the night pretty cold,
I do not find I have got any cold, or am any way disordered by it,
being fully sensible--Sufficient is the day for the evil thereof.

I am humbly thankful to the Lord Almighty for all his mercies, amongst which,
I esteem it a singular one to be enabled patiently to bear a separation from thee,
which at first seemed like a most painful division;
and although no time of our being united together has
passed in which thou wast dearer to me,
or my affections stronger than at this time, yet I am comfortably easy,
in hopes we may afresh be favoured with a personal reunion.
May the Shepherd of Israel be our keeper,
and his everlasting dew rest long upon our branches.

My companion, Israel Pemberton, is agreeable and helpful in various respects,
and hope he will receive some profit from this journey.

I have this day had a large, good meeting, to my satisfaction;
but the meeting-house being small, was inconvenient.
Most of the principal inhabitants attended,
and I expect the use of the Baptist meeting-house on first-day evening,
to take leave of the inhabitants of this place,
who have given general instances of their regard.

George Whitefield passed through this town a few days ago, for Georgia,
having travelled very hard from Philadelphia,
to get to his flock before we came amongst them.

I have now travelled two thousand five hundred and fifty miles,
upon the continent of America; of which,
one horse has carried me one thousand seven hundred and fifty;
he is an excellent creature,
and providentially put into my hands by a friend near Philadelphia.

He cost me about five pounds sterling; he travels with great ease and safety,
and sometimes, like his master, with hard fare, and sometimes none at all,
but we both jog on contentedly.
I intend him to rest here until my return from Georgia.

The state of the church is generally low, and exceedingly so in this place;
there is very little of the form, and much less of the power of Truth amongst them.
My heart has been bowed into strong concern, and close labour for and with them,
and hope for some little reviving of secret care in particular; but alas,
many seem awakened for a time, and sink afresh into lukewarmness.

Second-day morning, Second month, 17th.
Yesterday is comfortably passed over; the Baptist meeting-house was lent to us,
and we had a large, crowded meeting, to memorable satisfaction,
the ancient Helper vouchsafing to appear as mouth and wisdom:
to him be all glory ascribed.

I wrote to thee from this place about twelve days ago,
since which I have been in Georgia, and returned hither last night;
having continued cause of humble acknowledgments to the Father of all mercies,
for his support every way.
I have now been to the extent of my visit southward,
being one hundred and twenty miles further than
any Friend hath travelled on religious account,
and am setting my face northwards.
I propose another public meeting in this place tomorrow, and then to leave.

We have been much favoured with fine weather, and have excellent roads;
the heat has been rather troublesome, but not so much as to be very inconvenient.
Our road is through woods which are nearly always green,
being almost covered with myrtle, laurel, and bay trees,
which makes me often forget the time of the year;
none of the symptoms of our winters are here to be seen.

Wrightstown, (in America,) Second month 27th, 1755.

The freedom and candour of thy very acceptable favour,
has had the happy tendency to set me upon the strictest
examination of myself which my deceitful heart was capable of;
a task to which it was much disposed before the receipt of thine it,
being a season of emptying and cleansing: a state and dispensation,
which I pray with my whole heart that neither thou nor I may ever get above,
and especially when we are much engaged in our Master`'s work;
for it seems to me next to impossible that we should escape some little spots and stains:
though we may be ever so careful of our clothing, and wrap it ever so closely about us;
it will get a little soiled, by being used every day.
I am sure mine does so, and if I should hinder my Master from stripping it off,
and washing both it and me,
I should ere now have made but a very mean appearance in the
sight of Him who sees through every false covering,
the veil of flesh and all its seeming excellencies;
beholding no beauty nor comeliness in any thing that is not derived from himself,
who is the only unmixed fountain of light and purity.
And what does it signify, my dear friend,
if we appear naked and empty in the view of a set of mortals,
who are unacquainted with the Lord`'s ways and doings?
I think I have beheld in his light,
and been informed by the instruction of his pure Spirit,
that I have never been more amiable in his sight,
nor attracted a greater degree of his love, than when my spirit has been quite unclothed,
not only of my own righteousness, but also of the rich jewels of his grace,
and wandered about as in sheep skins and goat skins, destitute, afflicted, tormented,
in a spiritual as well as a natural sense;
nor have I ever had such near fellowship with the martyrs, apostles,
and fellow-sufferers of Christ, as in this state.

East Nottingham, Fourth month 10th, 1755.

I have often, and with true sympathy and nearness,
had thee in my remembrance since we parted,
and though I have been so situated as to be disqualified from much correspondence,
my hands being pretty full of labour, yet the various steps I had to tread,
in which I often found thine and thy dear companion`'s
footsteps secretly united in an inward inexpressible manner,
and I found both strength and comfort in suffering with
those who were baptized for the dead.
And indeed we may say.
Good is the word of the Lord, in all its manifestations,
and a tried buckler to the soul which is bowed, to keep its rank in the battle,
within or without, or both;
it is often our place to know it as a word requiring to be kept in reverend patience,
as with our mouths in the dust, and in deep emptiness and poverty.
Such has been my lot, and the best preparation for strength and nourishment,
in measure according to the will of God.
I have not forgotten thee, my friend and sister,
in the faith and patience of the gospel of Christ;
the spreading of fraternal affection in Christ, our holy head,
hath often reached towards thee, through invisible channels,
with strong desires and secret hope, that the arm of holy kindness will sustain,
and the rod and staff of the God of Jacob will be revealed to us both,
to guide in the midst of the paths of judgment.
I have found the rod often necessary for my instruction in righteousness;
and it is with reverence I have to acknowledge there is
a love in my heart to the chastening hand,
which, perhaps,
my own folly may make more necessary for me than some
other more dutiful and watchful children of his house.
Enable me, O Father,
to sing of thy mercies and judgment all the days of my appointed time.

I have travelled with diligence since I saw thee;
I left South Carolina easy and cheerful, having done what seemed my duty.
I thought, before I reached Charleston, that I should visit the adjacent islands,
but found a prohibition, though they invited me;
they seem desirous the testimony should be exalted by others, but will not lend a hand,
but according to the extent of their influence seem to me to pull down.
S having thrown, voluntarily, his children out of the Society,
I had true peace in plain dealing with them,
and the other libertine professors in that place.

By a letter from Lydia Lancaster, I have a good account of Isaac Wilson,
being a true born son into the ministry, and likely to become serviceable in it.

I desire, as for myself, thy preservation and stability in the truth of God,
and I cannot doubt, all-sufficiency will be near, as a fountain at times unsealed,
if we fail not in suitable inward watchfulness,
and are kept from repining at times of searching and sifting,
or from being wanton when the fulness of the house may be our portion.
Wisdom will lead in the middle of the paths of judgment; and if we love her discipline,
she will cause us to inherit substance.

The affectionate friendship which thine breathes is, with me, reciprocal,
and so it has been ever since our first acquaintance suggested
the most cordial desires for thy solid prosperity,
of which I have the strongest hopes.

I salute thee in the union of a friendship which is founded deeper than nature,
and remains fixed beyond dissolution.

Philadelphia, Fourth month 15th, 1755.

Through the continued protection of the God of all strength and sure mercy,
I have to inform thee of my safe return in good health, to this place,
where I am arrived, after a journey of three thousand miles, in about twenty-four weeks,
in which I passed through the remote mountainous parts of this province and Virginia,
and came down and travelled through that province.
North and South Carolina, and to Georgia.

When we left Charleston we had near four hundred and
fifty miles to ride to the next settlement of Friends,
through a country little inhabited, and in which accommodations were scarce enough,
though we made shift to get into some cabin or other at nights,
but had not my clothes off for several nights successively,
or any thing at times to lie down upon but a bear skin or boards;
but sufficient was the day for the evil thereof.
I was favoured with a state of perfect good health, and a quiet,
patient acquiescence with my lot,
having renewed reason to believe I was where I ought to be.
It is with a humble,
thankful heart I review the difficulties and jeopardies which have attended,
and through which gracious protection hath sustained me; record it, my soul,
in thine annals, to be often perused to thy humiliation.
I returned through Virginia to the western shore of Maryland,
and`' visited the meetings thereaway; which was made a time of renewed visitation to many,
and solid comfort in honest labour to myself.
On the 5th instant, I crossed the great river Susquehanna,
and came to the habitation of dear John Churchman,
where I met with a kind and affectionate reception.

I found not much time for respite, and visited several meetings in that neighbourhood,
in which I had his and his valuable wife`'s good company, to our mutual satisfaction.

The instances of mortality thou mentions are affecting and instructive hints to us, who,
for a short time survive, that we forget not that we also are strangers here,
and are hastily advancing to an unchangeable state.

The situation of affairs here occasions much discourse and tossing,
amongst those people who know not the foundation which stands sure.
A considerable number of the Indians have come down hither,
to remain until the hurries are over;
the vessels of the earth seem smiting one against another;
but I am not dismayed by any appearance of danger, nor drawn from my quiet habitation,
in the power of endless strength, to meddle at all,
otherwise than as I am often led to point out the only
refuge and hiding place which will protect,
and labour to gather the people`'s minds out of that which is wavering and unstable,
to the stability of the salvation of God.

I propose in a few days leaving this place and going down to New England,
and the parts adjacent, which I expect will take about five months`' moderate labour.
As the weather comes on warm I must relax my bow a little,
and travel with more indulgence to my body,
and thou may assure thyself I will endeavour to preserve a
being to which thou hast so great and just a claim:
the temperate season, the goodness of the roads,
the meanness and scarcity of accommodations, have obliged me to travel hard this season;
but as there is a total alteration in those respects, the weather coming on hot,
the roads worse, accommodations good, and meetings more frequent in my way,
I shall travel with more leisure than hitherto.

My good old faithful servant, who carried me about two thousand four hundred miles,
at last failed me; I have left him behind me in Virginia,
and yet hope some more good service from him; he travelled well and very easy,
and never failed until he was reduced to short allowance of food, and sometimes,
poor creature, none at all, unless I gave him my Indian bread,
which my own stomach wanted very much.
I was obliged to leave him; I had the pleasure of doing it in good, careful hands,
and bought another, which I hope will perform well.
My expenses have run very high,
though I have been as frugal as the nature of my journey would admit of;
but being obliged to hire guides, at a very great expense,
through the wilderness country, with various other daily expenses,
have made it absolutely necessary to spend a deal of money.

Philadelphia, Fourth month 17th, 1755.

Though we are outwardly far separated, yet as it is for a cause dear to us both,
and may it ever continue so, the secret,
invisible tie of all the family has not failed of its wonted
influence to unite in that which is stronger than nature;
in the renewing of this hidden virtue, I nearly and affectionately salute thee;
earnestly desiring we may redouble our diligence in humble
walking before Him who hath mercifully cared for us,
hath followed us from our tender years, in mercy and judgment,
and been more to us than we could ask or expect.
When I consider how many of our contemporaries, descended from worthy ancestors,
have been cast aside, and we yet remain, monuments of mercy,
and under the blessed notice of the Lord Almighty,
and enabled in our measures and gifts to build up his Zion, my spirit is deeply bowed,
in humble, reverent admiration,
and a request raised for strength to step rightly forward.
And as it is his own arm which has wrought for us hitherto, and not our own,
O that we might be more and more devoted to his service,
and careful to watch every turning of his hand,
in coming faithfully up in our very reasonable service.
Difficult it is, dear brother,
to keep our robes so clean as to stand with approbation in his sight,
who charges his angels with folly; but he is all-sufficient in strength; and,
as we steadfastly eye him,
not allowing the transient glare of this world`'s goods to ensnare,
he will clothe us with the white linen of saints; a better covering here,
and at an approaching hour, than all the friendships, honours,
and splendours below can ever furnish.

Thy affectionate care for my health, and prudent cautions against too much hurry,
are marks of a regard which shall not be extended to a person deaf to advice;
I find their force and truth,
and assure thyself they have that weight with me thou desires.
I have found great advantage to myself, and some service to others,
in the families of Friends,
from spending the evenings in such a manner as is
consistent with the end of my journey into these parts.

While the weather was cool or temperate, I travelled with great diligence,
yet left no place until I had carefully examined whether my business was finished;
and yet believe I must return to a quarterly meeting in Virginia,
before I leave this country; but the time is not yet.

I have now paid a very general visit to Friends in Maryland, Virginia,
North and South Carolina, and some of the remoter parts of this province;
in which I have been mercifully favoured with good health,
not being at all hindered by any indisposition of body;
nor in the whole journey of four thousand miles, lost half a day by bad weather,
nor suffered by travelling in it.
Our accommodations have been such as we could dispense with, much better,
I often thought, than our worthy predecessors in the same labour could possibly have.
And although many painful, pinching times have fallen to my lot,
yet the gracious spring of sure help hath been often unsealed,
and access vouchsafed to the renewing of humble trust in his all-sufficiency, on which,
whoever have carefully leaned, have never been left totally destitute.

I am disqualified to give thee any information
of the state of affairs in relation to the wars;
it is not my business,
and have found it my concern to deny my curiosity in inquiring after news,
or hearing anything about it.
I have found great peace in my endeavours by example and precept,
to draw Friends`' minds to their own warfare--that as
our hands cannot be active +++[+++in outward war],
so our minds cannot be embroiled +++[+++in it], consistently with our testimony.
Here are several of the chiefs of the Delawares come down to brighten the chain.

Friends here are very kind, in their frequent invitations to stay and rest a while;
but a succession of visitants from morning to evening deprives
me of time to converse with those I have a nearer regard for,
and subjects me to more fatigue than even daily travelling,
for then I am comfortably solitary, and often renew my strength.

Fourth month 18th, 1765.

Had opportunity allowed, I should, long ere this,
have acknowledged the receipt of thy affectionate lines,
though it is not easy to express that uniting virtue which cements the family together,
and brings them suddenly into an acquaintance and nearness of spirit that requires
not the ceremonies of the world`'s friendship to introduce nor its arts to maintain.
I have often been comforted in times of discouragement,
with this mark of having passed from death unto life, that I love the brethren.
I feel its prevalence at this time, and in it salute thee, thy dear husband and children,
with fervent desires that he who hath been your morning light and help hitherto,
may be your staff to lean upon, beloved ancients in Israel,
in this your decline of natural strength,
so as to fill up the station allotted you in the Church of Christ;
few are the ancients left,
to whom the middle aged and rising youth can look with advantage!
The Lord of heaven and earth hath gathered many to himself; the world,
in its various appearances, hath slain many others; and some, who are not yet dead,
have their garments so covered with dust, and spotted with defiling things,
that they are not fit to be looked upon, nor their footsteps to be inquired after.
But happy is the state of those advanced to old age,
whose conduct proclaims they have not followed cunningly devised fables,
but have been made living witnesses of the power and coming of Christ I
These have been powerful inducements to me to bow my heart in holy awe,
from childhood to this day,
(I mean with respect to outward means,) and I am thankful to the great preserver of men,
that there are such here and there to be found; and,
though painful baptisms for Zion`'s sake may attend, in viewing the backslidings of many,
yet ability is given, at times,
to appeal with reverend confidence to the searcher of hearts;
"`Thou knowest how I have walked before thee!`"
I trust this will be your crown of rejoicing, in an hour approaching,
which I could wish very remote from you,
except that the laws of nature proclaim it to be near.

The same love and hearty well-wishing attend your offspring!
May they so acquaint themselves with the God of their parents, as to stand in their lots,
and be found worthy to have their names appear in the register of the Lamb`'s army!
Beloved young friends, suffer the advice of one that loves you,
though outwardly a stranger, to have place in your minds.
The experience of many years has taught me that godliness is profitable for all things,
and that real happiness is known in proportion to the progress of it in our hearts.
If you look around among your contemporaries, you will find it a sealed truth,
and unspeakably comfortable to this wise number,
who have sought with unwearied diligence the kingdom of God, first in time,
as it is first in value.
How beautiful upon the mountains have been the feet of these! and how
strong the voice with which their conduct has proclaimed good tidings!
Salvation hath been their portion, and peace their safe refuge.
They have been qualified to maintain their testimony,
and earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.
Where began these?
In the immediate operation of the power of Truth in their hearts,
in a humble waiting and resignation to the Divine will,
not making haste from under the refining hand.
All who have known an advancement in true godliness have begun upon this foundation:
upon this low ground, but sure foundation, your worthy parents began,
and built with success, and now know how precious it is in advanced life.
The dew of the everlasting hills, and a sufficient share of the fatness of the earth,
are the portion of every soul, which, above all other considerations,
seeks the Lord in truth and sincerity.
O, saith my soul, may there be such a heart in you as to fear the Lord Almighty,
and keep his commandments always, that it may be well with you and your children.
Thus my spirit salutes you, dear youth, in the spreading of concern for your good;
that you may, by means of heavenly help, be made truly happy in yourselves,
a comfort to your aged parents, and useful to your brethren in the Church of Christ.

I have travelled with much diligence, according to the ability given,
and have had my experience enlarged in rejoicing and suffering;
the last has been often my lot, but I dare not repine; to be what I ought is my only aim,
and best Wisdom knows the method to make me so; in his will I humbly acquiesce.

Ellen Evans was the wife of John Evans: he as a minister, and she in the office of elder,
were both valuable members of the monthly meeting of Gwynedd, in Pennsylvania.
He was born in Denbighshire,
and in the year 1698 removed with his parents to Pennsylvania.
In the twenty-third year of his age he appeared in the ministry of the Gospel;
he was deeply learned in heavenly truths, and plain in declaring them.
He was a zealous promoter of visiting Friends in their families,
and often engaged therein, and his labours were awakening and useful.
He travelled through most of the American provinces,
and having served God in his generation, he departed in the ninth month, 1756.

Ellen Evans was born near Dolgelly, in 1685, and removed to America when very young.
She had a good understanding, which being enriched and sanctified by Divine grace,
soon distinguished her as one seeking heavenly treasure,
and she became an honourable member of Society.

She was exemplary in her family, and remarkable for piety and industry,
rising early in the morning, and encouraging others to do so; often observing,
that those who rose late lost the youthful beauty of the day,
and wasted its most precious part; that the sun was the candle of the world,
which called upon us to arise and diligently apply to our several duties.
Except on meeting days, it was her practice to retire about noon,
with the Bible or some religious book, and spend a portion of her time alone,
often to her great refreshment.
She frequently assembled her family in the evenings to read the Holy Scriptures,
with which, as well as with the writings of Friends, she was thoroughly acquainted.

She died on the 29th of fourth month, 1765, aged eighty years.

I have continued cause to acknowledge the kindness of Providence,
in preserving my health and ability to labour in his service;
although it is very hard and close work which falls to my portion,
yet I endeavour after quiet contentment in my lot,
and all my desires centre in this point, that His heavenly presence,
who is my light and my strength, may accompany, and then all will be right and well;
and I may acknowledge, with reverence.
His hand has wonderfully supplied and opened in all wisdom and counsel,
to the help of the faithful, and the rousing up of the careless and forgetful,
and staying my mind upon Him who is the companion and help of his own afflicted seed.
Oh may we both so dwell with and walk before him, as ever to know him at our right hand,
that we may not be moved in any of the disquietudes and
tossings that this world produces.

I closed my last under much concern on sister Ann`'s account;
several circumstances had created in my mind a
persuasion that she has finished her course,
and if it be so,
I make no doubt but she has a residence beyond the reach of pain and sorrow forever.
The ties of nature are strong; the removal of so near relations afflicting;
the apprehension of it, and my own exercise for the church,
have been very heavy upon me for some weeks past.

We had a large, good meeting in this city last evening, much to my ease,
and I am preparing to go to Long Island.

Flushing, (Long Island,) Fifth month 26th, 1755.

Although a constant series of employment hath prevented my testifying
my affectionate remembrance of thee and thy dear spouse and children,
yet I can with great truth assure thee,
you have been very frequently the companions of my thoughts;
and though unfitted at present, by deep poverty and leanness,
for any beneficial correspondence, I cannot dismiss my dear and worthy companion,
thy brother John, without some token of affectionate regard, which, I flatter myself,
is from the dictates of pure friendship, which I often feel is reciprocal.

I have been led, since we parted, into frequent and deep suffering,
in the view and feeling sense of the suffering state of the church all along,
which sits in the dust, and has on her mourning weeds,
although there are a few who have kept their garments clean;
but the lamentable defection of those who would be thought the head,
but are the tail--I mean the more advanced in years,
profession and station amongst the people--gives a painful prospect.
And as it is hard to lift up a hand against gray hairs,
my progress has been more difficult and afflicting than I can express.
However, I have to acknowledge with reverence,
heavenly assistance has been at times helpfully near,
to my full discharge and ease in my painful labour,
though I believe I must traverse a second time some steps I have already trod.

I have been sustained to travel and labour with diligence,
and to my secret comfort and ease in most places; but the work is very laborious,
having not only the burden of the state of the churches at times upon me,
with respect to the work of the ministry, but the revival of discipline,
too much neglected by many of those who seem most active for truth`'s service,
and opposed by a ranting spirit, which hates discipline,
and represents it as a lording over one another`'s faith.
In both respects, I have been concerned to labour closely, and to some service.
I have performed a general visit to Long Island,
and some parts of the continent belonging to that province,
and was at their yearly meeting, held at Flushing, which was very large and satisfactory,
through faithful, awakening labour, to the careless and worldly-minded.
I then visited some part of Long Island, and travelled to this place,
one hundred and eighty miles, where I came last night.
The extreme heat of the weather, with my large crowded meetings,
are weakening to my natural strength, but all-sufficiency is graciously near,
for help in all respects, and in that my confidence stands.
I have had a large open meeting here this day, and propose,
after attending some adjacent, to return to the yearly meeting here,
I suppose the largest in one meeting-house in the world.

My worthy friend, thy good husband, with whom I have travelled thirteen weeks,
had several meetings among the Presbyterians at Boston, Marblehead, Portsmouth,
in New Hampshire, and at Jamaica, on Long Island, which were very large,
and to his and the people`'s satisfaction, being as eminently favoured, if not more so,
amongst this people than any other;
and I am fully persuaded his labours of love will never be forgotten by some of them,
especially at Boston and Portsmouth;
and should he ever find a concern to return to those parts,
I believe it will be on account of those people, and not those of our Society; but,
as I have said, he thinks himself clear of them, and is perfectly easy.

He set out, immediately after our yearly meeting was over, for Nottingham,
in company with John Churchman, to attend a large meeting held there once a-year,
and then intends for Cecil and some other meetings in and near Maryland,
proposing to return to our quarterly meeting about six weeks hence.

I am heartily thankful I was favoured to be his companion,
and hope I retain a due sense and remembrance of the many
seasonable and weighty advices given from time to time,
together with the refreshing seasons at some of the meetings,
and should be pleased I could say they were more generally satisfactory; but truth is,
I think, but at a low ebb in those parts,
especially amongst the elders and those of the most advanced years--
great deadness and barrenness appearing amongst them in most places,
which has caused some hard, affecting service to thy good husband.
The youth have a more promising aspect,
and seem to be sensible of the declension of the church,
and zealous for restoring her primitive beauty,
which is cause of joy to the humble in heart,
and those that are anxious on that account.

I have continued cause of thankfulness to the Almighty hand,

who rightly remember our father and his God.
Oh that I may never forget His mercies, which are sure, even to his children`'s children!

The yearly meeting begins at Nantucket this day two weeks,
and I believe I may take in their course most of the quarterly meetings in New England,
which I am desirous of doing, as their discipline is much neglected,
and the revival thereof is no small part of my concern and labour.

In the renewings of that hidden sympathy and nearness,
which truth itself gives those that diligently abide in it,
to feel with and for one another, I affectionately salute you, who are at this time,
and many others, as epistles written in my heart, and helps in my way forward;
with earnest supplication to the Lord, our alone Helper, that he who hath been our Alpha,
and mercifully regarded us, even beyond many of our contemporaries,
for our health and salvation,
and who hath given the earnest in measure of the promised inheritance,
may ever be the single object of honour and pure worship in our eyes,
that thereby strength may be known to bear up
and sustain our souls in travail and baptisms,
many others are strangers to; for few are the footsteps, of this age at least,
that can be discerned in the path,
a little remnant--of which you are and I long to be--are travelling in,
which is cast up of God, and leads to that peaceful Omega,
where the weary enjoy peace without interruption.
I have nothing to write of the goodness, sure mercy, and salvation of God,
which you know not already, and are stepping in the line which enlarges experience;
but I wanted to give you an assurance of my most affectionate feeling with you,
and for you; and it hath been a comfortable consideration to me,
in many secretly pained hours, that I have one mark of passing from death to life,
in that I truly love the brotherhood.

Perhaps by this time you may have pretty nearly visited
all the meetings in this part of the world,
and may be judged by many, consequently ready to leave it, and return home.
I have just a freedom to say, "`Stand still,
look about you closely;`" I believe you went not into the business unrequired;
but leave not hastily any little service that may spread with a degree of permission,
liberty and openness.
Although absolute necessity does not at present attend it,
the heavenly Master may yet prove the quickness of your attention by a low voice,
on your faithfulness to which, your peace may much depend.
I leave the hint, and very likely it may be needless.

I crave for you, as for myself, the blessing of a peaceful,
safe return to your native shore, and the plenteous reward of peace;
if it be not largely distributed, but kept in the Master`'s hand, it is, nevertheless,
sure, and will be handed to you in wise and suitable times and portions.

I should be glad of a farewell epistle, if freedom and convenience admit;
my heart will nearly sympathize with you, when on the mighty waves;
and may your remembrance be of me, and prayers for me,
that my goings may be established in the precarious passage
through the remainder of my labours in this part of the world.

Ponygansett, Sixth month 23rd, 1755.

I have continued cause of humble thankfulness to the ever blessed Helper,
for his support vouchsafed from day to day,
proportioning strength to the time and trial inwardly and outwardly.
Yet many are the painful seasons I have passed,
on account of the general state of the church,
which have issued in more proper qualification to
labour for the help and regulation of things amongst us.

Long Island was a laborious place, for little present earnings.
We went by water from Setawket to Seabrook, twenty-two leagues in one day;
and then to Newport.
The yearly meeting was large and well, being a fresh visitation to many there,
of all ranks, especially the youth.
I found some engagement to attend my mind respecting the discipline;
and got some queries prepared and transmitted to the quarterly, monthly,
and preparative meetings, to be answered in the subordinate meetings,
and to the yearly meeting.
Another set of queries were sent to be read, considered, and answered,
in all the meetings for ministers and elders;
and answered to their yearly meeting of ministers and elders.
I was concerned to recommend the like to the women Friends,
who also accepted my labour therein,
and sent down a few queries relative more immediately to their own conduct,
to the several women`'s meetings.
I know not what advantage may redound to the church, but it brought me great peace,
in the sense of a discharge of my duty,
in this labour for the revival of that discipline which
Divine wisdom placed as a hedge about his vineyard,
when he planted it in the morning of our day.

Great is the work the Lord our God has begun, and is carrying on in the earth,
for the promotion of his own glory; and, indeed,
few are the faithful labourers in his harvest;
though there are knees bowed before the Holy One of Israel, who have not bowed to Baal,
who will in due time be brought forth into the field,
and strengthened to labour successfully in the church of Christ.
I think I see such a remnant lying almost out of sight in some parts of America,
by and in whom God will arise and get himself a name.
Unwearied are Satan`'s endeavours to hurt the service of such,
and render the beginnings of the work upon them useless to themselves and others.

I have often, dear Israel, remembered thee in a distinguished manner;
being sensible the Lord of all power and wisdom would
clothe with eminent qualifications for his service,
in this thy day, in which the church has on her sable weeds,
and her priests are in bitterness.
He who is the giver of every excellent gift,
hath endowed thee beyond many of thy contemporaries,
and I know he would bless thee in them to his own service and thy peace.
The meekness of the lamb, the humility and abasedness of a disciple, add strength,
beauty, and true weight to all labour in the church of Christ.
Oh that thy spirit might be more and more seasoned and bowed
with and by that power which alone sanctifies our all to God,
and doeth his work and service.
I have seen thee, dear friend, in the hidden conflict,
and the struggle between the two opposite powers, and have sympathized with and for thee,
when thou hast been bruised and hurt by the prevalence
of that which stands as an armed man in thy way to rest.
I am sensible of thy secret bemoaning at times, when loss hath been sustained,
and the renewal of holy reaches for I by help and recovery;
I earnestly wish for thee as well as for myself,
the thorough subjection of all within us to that abasing, humbling hand,
who prepares instruments for his service from the dust of Zion,
and ordains praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.
In the spreading of tender love, I could lay my hands under thy feet, if necessary,
that thou might receive strength to reign in the Lamb`'s dominion,
over all which diminishes that excellent service thou might grow up in,
for the revival and strengthening of the Lord`'s cause in thy generation.

Accept, dear friend, this salutation, the fruits of love unfeigned, in good part.

It is Truth which strengthens the nearest union,
and renders it truly near and comfortable one to another; and in the living,
holy sense thereof, I most tenderly and affectionately salute thee.
I am still helped to labour with such a degree
of strength as to feel the reward of true peace,
that my heart is bowed in holy thanksgiving to the
all-sufficient Helper for the support of his ancient arm,
and humblingly encouraged to trust in him when
more pinching times are permitted to attend.
I have made some advances in my experience to know what it is to want,
and what it is to abound, for I never knew more of baptisms for the dead,
nor the glorious arising of the mighty power of God, in all wisdom, strength and counsel,
than this journey has given me to feel: the gain of all be consecrated to him,
who is ever worthy.

I found in Newport, on Rhode Island, a valuable number of relations,
the children of my father`'s sister, some of whom are deeply solid Friends,
to whom I was united in the hidden covenant of spiritual kindred,
and strongly hope for their preservation in the way of truth and righteousness.
My uncle is still living, an innocent, good old man.^
footnote:[John Proud.]

We were eminently favoured with the Divine presence,
in the whole course of that great yearly meeting at Newport;
and a large share of labour fell to my lot, both in ministry,
and endeavouring to restore discipline, which, with respect to its usefulness,
was nearly lost amongst them.
The Lord enabled me to labour with success,
and queries were prepared and sent down into the
quarterly meetings of ministers and elders,
with directions to establish monthly meetings of the same nature;
and other queries to the monthly and quarterly meetings;
also queries for the women`'s use, as in England, all which fell to my lot to draw up;
also an epistle to the several meetings of ministers and elders in the province;
that it was a time of close labour to me,
and took up some hours of the time I ought to have slept.
But all is well; the great Name is spreading itself afresh to an unfaithful people,
with merciful extending of holy help; he will be clear,
and enable his servants to be clear, and to stand in their lot at the end of days,
as they abide faithful.

On the 18th instant I left Newport, and had meetings at Accoaxet, Accushanet, Rochester,
Newtown, and two very large meetings at Aponyganset; two days we were upon the waters,
coming hither, where we arrived well.
I was more sick in coming these twenty-five leagues,
than one thousand one hundred from the Land`'s end of England to the Capes of Delaware,
The yearly meeting, begun here yesterday, was large, but a hard, shut up meeting,
as most I have been at in America.

I expect to be upon the main again next week;
and I believe it must be my lot to visit all the quarterly meetings in New England,
in order further to direct the use of the queries sent down.
This will cause a considerable increase of bodily labour; but to be found faithful,
just and true, in the measure of the gospel labour committed to me,
is the aim and desire of my mind.

Dear John Pemberton accompanied me from Philadelphia to Flushing, on Long Island,
greatly to my satisfaction; the more I know of that valuable youth, the more I love him.
At Flushing, William Logan,
a certain great man in the world--but his greatness is
more eminent in his religious capacity--joined me,
and is now my agreeable companion through New England; he is a choice friend,
and had John Churchman`'s recommendation with him to entitle him to be my companion;
and although no public minister in word and doctrine,
is an exemplary preacher of righteousness in life and conversation,
and of these preachers the world has great need.

Another meeting for worship hath been this day held,
in which truth arose in its own dominion, and crowned our assembling with living virtue,
to the help of the true-hearted,
and placing the testimony of truth over all transgressors in an eminent manner:
the gain of all is justly due to Him from whom all strength and ability proceed.

I would gladly hope to be at Philadelphia in the ninth month next,
at their yearly meeting, which I want to see; but this poor New England wants help,
and the Heavenly Master hath given me great place amongst them,
that I know not whether I shall be thoroughly easy,
but leave it to the disposal of all-wise Providence,
whose service I have more in view than any other consideration.

I affectionately sympathize with poor E. T., in the loss of her daughter,
yet believe she is removed in mercy, whilst measurably innocent.
I have had, since I left home, that young woman often in my thoughts,
and was not sorry when I heard of her removal,
though it might be a stroke severe enough upon a natural parent,
and more than they know well how to bear;
to see their beloved offspring torn away must make their hearts bleed for them,
and for their loss; yet Infinite Wisdom hath sometimes prevented a greater affliction,
by administering one that is easier.
I therefore hope dear Esther, whom I nearly remember,
will patiently acquiesce in the present dispensation, under this certain sense,
that high, heavenly, and wise is He who hath been pleased to strip her to the one band,
who hath heretofore rejoiced in many.
My dear love is to her;
and O that her son Abraham may consider the obligation he is under to mitigate her pain,
by every instance of dutiful regard,
that she may find some relief from painful distress in him.
But if even this fail, Truth itself remains,
the everlasting stay and unchangeable spring of comfort in all affliction.

Nantucket, Sixth month 28th, 1755.

Here is a very large meeting of professors upon this island, which is,
with respect to its soil, a sunk bank in the sea,
about fifteen miles long and three broad.
The yearly meeting, finished here this day, was very large, the place considered,
being more than one thousand five hundred, principally professors of truth, at meeting,
and about four hundred out at sea, fishing for whales.
A convincement there was formerly amongst them, and a body of good Friends remain;
but as the richest part of the inhabitants
embraced the principles of Truth from conviction,
the others thought the expense of maintaining a priest would be too heavy for them,
and have turned Quakers to save money; though I hope, even amongst them,
the power of the begetting word is in degree at work,
to give a surer title to the family of Christ.

There is another island, about ten leagues off,
where no European Friends have hitherto been, that I have heard of;
it is called Martha`'s Vineyard; I cannot with ease of mind pass it by,
and intend to sail for it soon after midnight,
intending to have a meeting there tomorrow afternoon,
and thence to the main land of New England,
and would gladly hope to be again in Philadelphia in the ninth month.
I have looked about me, in every place I have left,
whether I had any more service required; and though I have used great diligence,
I have not made haste, but believe I must have another fatiguing journey into Virginia.
My poor old horse, I am afraid, is dead; I was obliged to leave him;
nature could not do more;
he travelled one hundred and fifty miles with me without even
having so much as a quartern of English oats;
I was obliged to beg a little Indian bread for my own support, for none could I buy,
and I divided it honestly between him and myself.
My companion, Israel Pemberton`'s horse, I hear, died soon after we left them,
and the departure of my poor old "`Buck`" was daily expected.

Epistle to Friends of Penketh Meeting.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Nantucket, Sixth month 28th, 1755.

[.salutation]
Dearly beloved Friends,

In the sensible renewings of that melting, humbling love,
which hath often bowed my spirit and yours in reverend, holy worship,
when present with you, do I affectionately salute the truly living amongst you,
as present in spirit, though, for the cause of truth,`' far separated in body; yet,
by no means less inwardly anxious for your establishment in the unchangeable truth,
than when present amongst you,
and engaged in labour for your help and growth into
your several measures of the fulness of Christ.
In which true love, my spirit hath often secretly reached towards you; and of late,
with that unreserved openness,
as to allow me at least a liberty to salute you with a token of love unfeigned.

First to you, my beloved friends, partakers of the heavenly calling,
who have surely known him in whom you have believed,
and been made witnesses of his powerful resurrection unto life;
my soul is at this instant bowed, with and for you,
that nothing may be admitted to weaken your hold,
or diminish your following on to know him, and his work,
who hath made his voice known and his holy arm bare for your help.
I have seen the snares laid in your way; the love of the world,
and the indolent rest in the remembrance of former favour;
together with the strong touches of heavenly help,
which have been considered as marks of approbation of your present state,
rather than what the Lord Almighty intended them for,
even strong inducements to follow on to know him.
This fatal mistake hath sometimes led the truly visited into a partial work,
and centred them in a false rest; in a low, and dwarfish, weak state,
subject to frequent failures and bruises,
which have eclipsed and dimmed the beauty which the
Lord of the heritage would have endued you with.
Therefore, beloved friends, wait for and submit to the shaking, loosening power,
which would lead from the unnecessary embarrassments of this world;
for such are those which lead to forget God.
Follow faithfully to Bethel, to Jericho, through Jordan,
and to the last vision of the heavenly messenger;
so shall a double portion of the Spirit rest upon you,
and the name and cause of the Highest be magnified, your own treasures enlarged,
and those who are behind encouraged, by your example,
to diligence and steady care to possess the like durable inheritance.
On the contrary, where negligence and weakness, through a worldly spirit,
prevail amongst the seeming foremost ranks, it encourages in undue liberties,
relaxes necessary care after their own help,
and is a stumbling-block in the way of the weak,
who gladly admit of these discouraging prospects, as they flatter their own negligence,
and speak a language calculated to indulge them in their remissness
suitably to labour for hidden treasure in their own possession.
Let, therefore, the word of exhortation be received by you,
to stir up to an increase in faithful obedience;
ever bearing in your remembrance the lovingkindness of the Lord of sure mercies,
and its end, even your own establishment, and the help of others by your living example;
that you, being faithful followers of him who hath entered into rest, may say to others,
"`Follow me, as I follow Christ.`"

And I am fully assured that the reverend, honest travellers amongst you,
to whom my spirit is secretly united, will not be overlooked.
Although they may have pensively to muse on the roll written within and without,
lamentation, mourning, and woe, He who has bowed the heavens,
and come down for the help of his own seed,
will not turn away his holy ear from their requests,
but speedily arise for their sure deliverance.

You also, my friends,
who are not so sensibly united by a birth from the immortal seed to the true family,
as I have often begged for you, have a place in my remembrance,
and an affectionate concern that you might be prevailed
with to work while it is yet day with you,
and be excited to seek after the one thing; a solemn approaching hour will convince you,
that it is absolutely necessary for peace and rest forever.
How long hath the gracious Hand been extended for your help! even all the day long,
until the evening has drawn near, and his locks have been wet with its dews;
unwilling to leave, and graciously mindful of you.
Oh! that none such may survive the extending of
the blessed arm of all-substantial strength,
and remain in advanced life as trees twice dead, and plucked up by the roots,
reserved for Tophet, prepared of old for those who forget God.

And O, that the youth amongst you, to whom even Dives`'s desire for his brethren,
that one might be raised and sent from the dead to warn them, hath been granted,
of which I am a living monument,
might be roused in every heart to seek carefully after their own interest,
and to study betimes those things which can alone make their lives truly comfortable,
and enable them to fill up their essential duties here,
and rest in peace at the solemn approaching conclusion.
Whatever place it may now have with you, satisfied I am,
you have been eminently favoured; and line upon line, precept upon precept,
have been given, in the spreading of gathering love and mercy,
which my soul craves your reverent remembrance of to your profit;
for they will not fall to the ground, but remain,
as profitable direction to the right-minded,
or a dreadful hand-writing upon the wall against the rebellious and negligent.
For thus, even now, saith the Lord Almighty,
respecting the issue of his word to his visited
people as of old--"`As the rain cometh down,
and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth,
and maketh it bring forth and bud,
that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void,
but it shall accomplish that which I please,
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.`"

O, therefore, dear young friends, be warned in time to bow in heart to this word,
that you may know it to be a word of sure comfort in a
day when nothing else can speak peace to the soul;
and that, through its sanctifying virtue,
you may be made vessels of honour in the house of God,
that the labour frequently and affectionately bestowed
upon you may not be in vain to any among you.
I am sensible that there are good desires at times present in some of your minds; but,
alas! often weakened by the hurtful things which
are spread as snares in the path of youth,
and which often endanger the unwary, careless mind, and lead it into certain destruction;
but there is an all-sufficient Hand,
able and willing to direct and support in all perils,
and to conduct steadily and safely to that desirable possession,
which is reserved for those, of all ranks and of every age, who seek diligently,
by faith and patience, to inherit glory.

I have, on my own account, cause of reverent worship,
for the continuance of daily support, proportioned not to my deserving,
but to the abundant condescension of a gracious God, who hath every way helped me,
inwardly and outwardly, in this laborious service,
and hath supplied with wisdom and strength to labour to some service,
and my own great peace, in humble, reverent trust in his unchangeable love and help,
which hath not yet failed.
So that I have often, with a soul inwardly melted before the throne of grace,
admired His goodness, and had to acknowledge His unutterable kindness and mercy,
in engaging my heart to devote the bloom and strength of my life to his service,
who is ever worthy of love, obedience, and the tribute of a devoted heart.
Amen, amen.

Thus, beloved friends, the yearning of an affectionate heart reaches to you,
and craves for you sure help in the way of righteousness and peace;
that if I be restored again to you, there may be a sensible increase and growth;
that you may be a joyful prospect to me, and that my return, if permitted,
and of which I have a secret hope, may be to you in the fulness of the Gospel of peace,
and not with sorrow and distress on your account.

The everlasting, holy, and unchangeable God of all comfort be near you,
to strengthen that which remains alive, and should live,
to support you in every difficulty,
and preserve you as a well fenced and frequently watered garden,
is the prayer of your true friend and well-wisher,

During the visit of Samuel Fothergill to the island of Nantucket,
his mind was much exercised on account of a difference which then,
and had for a long time previously, existed amongst some Friends there;
this he took much pains to remove,
and after he left them he felt engaged to address to
the monthly meeting the following letter:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

[.letter-heading]
To Friends of the Monthly Meeting of Sherborne, Nantucket.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Sandwich, Seventh month 4th, 1755.

[.salutation]
Dear Friends,

I have found so much secret travail and concern of soul,
on the account of your present circumstances, as not to allow me with true ease of mind,
to dismiss the Friends who have kindly accompanied us,
without a few lines of brotherly advice and counsel.

First, and principally, to those more immediately active in the government of the church,
and the management of truth`'s affairs: let a suitable search be made,
in and by what spirit you are conducted in all your services, in the, meekness of wisdom,
that loves and seeks the establishment one of another in the unchangeable truth,
the ground and rule of all your motions and advances,
that you may act for God in your day, and be happy with him at last.
Is this, my friends, your chief aim in His sight,
who knows all the secrets of men`'s hearts, and every view of the mind;
or hath not rather the interposition of other things weakened some of your hands,
and opened another eye than that single one to God`'s glory,
which his true-hearted servants, both in ministry and discipline,
are truly concerned to keep open; and to the head,
Christ Jesus--which hath apparently diminished the beauty which, I believe,
once rested in a more eminent degree upon that island than at present?
O, Friends! how hath it happened?
At whose door may it be laid?
I fear the head hath been sick,
and thence weakness and infirmity spread itself into the body,
and rendered it unfit for his descent into our assemblies, who, of old,
required the removal of the lepers out of his camp,
as a previous step to his abiding amongst the congregation;
and if the leprosy of the lowest class of the people could thus prevent Heavenly regard,
what shall we not have occasion to fear,
if amongst the chiefs and principal heads of the tribes any lepers be found,
for such are all those whose minds the god of this world hath defiled,
and led them to seek their own things, more than the things of Christ,
and sometimes even at the price of the church`'s peace.

I am much a stranger, and desire to be so,
who hath been the occasion of the present breach of union amongst you;
but I am clearly and fully convinced,
that had those watchmen who take that name upon them been awake,
and quick of understanding in the fear of God,
they might have been instrumental in preventing its
spreading out into those branches that are apparent;
and although I shall not make myself a judge and divider amongst you,
with respect to the validity of the claim of any, yet this I am very clear in,
that those who made themselves judges in their own cause,
without pursuing the constant advice of Friends, to refer their claims to proper judges,
mutually chosen by both parties--and in consequence thereof,
turned out their cattle -- made a breach of the
rules prescribed by Divine wisdom for our Zion,
and the beast of the field broke through into the Lord`'s vineyard: therefore,
the likely way to issue this affair seems to me to
restore things to the situation they were in formerly,
and if any Friends think their rights abridged,
to request jointly the assistance of your quarterly meeting; in the mean time,
keep out of reflections and evil surmises one against another,
and abide in the peaceable spirit of the Lamb, which alone will be finally victorious.

Let the establishment of the family be dear to you all; and O,
that the keepers of the flock, both ministers and elders,
may so watch over them as to have to say,
I have lost none of those committed to my trust, but have watched over them for good,
and preferred Jerusalem`'s welfare to my chiefest joy.
My heart is pained for you, and truth amongst you;
and I am strongly bowed down before the Almighty, in intercession,
for a time of reviving from his own presence amongst the more aged with you,
and the more active leaders, that the cause, eminently owned of God amongst you,
may not perish, and you, also, in your negligence.

And oh, thou little distressed remnant, who have communication together,
and are sad -- the heritage that mourns to the Lord in the
sense of the numbers that are slain on the high places--let
thine eye be to that Alpha who was the beginner of all good,
and he will be thy Omega, the author and finisher of thy faith;
the companion and stay of his own seed is he, and will arise for their help.

And now, dear Friends, in the sense of best regard, my heart pleads with you;
for Zion`'s sake, follow after peace with God, and one with another,
that the God of love and peace may ever be with you;
in this peace alone stands that farewell my soul craves for you all.

I am your Friend, concerned for your true help,

Nantucket, Seventh month, 1755.

I have to acknowledge the receipt of thy acceptable letter,
and although I have little to say which can recommend my writing,
yet I do love to be in the way of getting good,
by maintaining a correspondence with such as are capable of communicating it.
I have, through continued mercy, cause of thankful acknowledgment to the gracious Hand,
for his support every way hitherto; although many painful hours are to be met with,
yet I am helped to be generally quiet, and this is to me a great and good attainment.
Sometimes I think I can see that my commission has passed the proper office,
and got seals to it; at other times I can scarcely see either seal or commission, which,
though a painful dispensation, is profitable to quicken to diligence,
to be very attentive to my Master`'s directions, and quick of understanding in his will;
and that, above all things, I may know an abode in his service,
though but in the most seemingly trivial employment, yet to any honest employ for bread,
am I heartily willing to have my hand turned.

I have been stirring about pretty closely since we parted;
we had a large meeting at Flushing, but low and distressing,
as indeed was my passage in general through Long Island.
The meeting at Newport was very large and satisfactory; brought in the reward of peace,
through close, painful labour.
I found my mind greatly engaged for the revival of discipline amongst them,
in which I laboured with some seeming success.
The meeting here hath been large, and, as times go, pretty well upon the whole,
the state of the people considered.
There is a considerable body of Friends who are true members of the family.

Boston, Seventh month 31st, 1755.

I wrote thee from Nantucket about five weeks ago,
since which time I have travelled as diligently as I could,
and have visited several parts eastward of this city, and had many very large meetings,
both amongst Friends and in several places where Truth opened my way amongst others,
where no Friends lived, which have been signally satisfactory and serviceable.
It hath bowed my heart in reverence,
to observe and feel the openness and visitation of love and life which is
manifest in various places in this formerly persecuting government;
the authority heretofore exerted to suppress our meetings,
is now watchful to support them,
and in many places the principal people flock into meetings in crowds,
and behave with great solidity.
I had yesterday a large and memorably good meeting in the court-house, at Marblehead,
about twenty miles distant;
and about two weeks ago one of the most eminently favored meetings I have been at,
in the court-house, at Portsmouth;
and three offers to have any place of worship they had, if I would stay another meeting.
I mention it with a bowed, reverent heart, acknowledging it is the Lord`'s doing,
and awfully marvellous in my eyes.

Though heavenly support to labour is often renewed, and inward peace sustains and covers,
yet I have largely tasted of the cup of suffering,
as I have felt the state of the churches as I have gone along;
there is a remnant truly living, and true though weak children,
who want help and guidance, and seek it,
to whom the merciful regard of the Lord of heaven and earth, freely reaches,
and through whom I hope for the revival of ancient beauty;
they are principally of the rising generation;
the greater part of the more advanced in years
are rather obstructions than helps in the way,
and must be removed before the family will be rightly
replenished and strengthened from the Living Fountain.
It has been exceedingly hard to my nature to treat gray
hairs in the manner Truth itself hath led,
but I saw no other way to peace than true obedience, in which,
though through affliction and distress, I have found heavenly regard, and I ask no more.

Boston, Eighth month 1st, 1755.

Since my last I have pursued my journey eighty miles eastward of this city,
and was about to go down to Casio Bay,
to see two small meetings of Friends who have gone and settled there,
about seventy miles distant from any other meetings in the province,
but unexpectedly found a stop in my mind,
and a curtain seemed to be drawn betwixt me and those parts,
which I could not see through,
and found my way opened to appoint some meetings amongst the people,
and then return to Boston.
As soon as I had finished the service of the appointed meetings,
I was seized with violence by the gout in my feet and stomach,
and having procured a carriage, I returned to the house of Zaccheus Collins, at Linn,
a kind Friend, who hath a valuable wife and daughters,
who waited upon me with great affection,
and where I had every assistance they could afford me;
and through the blessing of Divine goodness, and the plentiful use of the bark, the fit,
which I feared would be tedious, left me in a few days.
I was pretty much disabled for six days, but got out to two large meetings at Lynn,
on first-day--one at Salem,
and a very large and memorably good meeting at
Marblehead-- and came to their meeting here yesterday,
which was large and satisfactory.

I could not but admire the gracious Hand, in preventing my journey eastwards;
I must have been exposed to many hardships, and no assistance;
my bed might have perhaps been in the woods, in that time of distress.
Since my recovery, I have carefully looked whether I am fully clear, and I believe I am,
and at liberty to return towards Rhode Island.
It is now (except one day) twelve months since I left my own habitation;
many painful events have attended, much close labour and travail every way,
but all-sufficient Help and Goodness remains gracious, renewing a humble,
reverent trust that he will, in his own time, re-conduct me home to my native land,
and to my friends and relations, both in the natural and spiritual alliance;
but the time when, is hid beyond the veil, and right it should be.

2nd of Eighth month.--I dropped my pen yesterday,
under a weighty concern to appoint an evening meeting in this place;
and upon its being mentioned to the magistrates,
they cheerfully offered either one of their own places of worship, or the town-hall,
saying that our own house was too small to
accommodate the people who inclined to come in.
I found more freedom to accept their offer of the hall,
and had a very large meeting in the evening,
at which were present about two thousand people,
and amongst them nearly all the magistracy of the place,
several of their ministers and principal people.
It was a time, I believe, never to be forgotten;
the power and wisdom of Truth was a canopy over the meeting,
and I believe the Truth itself gained great ground: let every part of the gain, glory,
and profit be ascribed to that excellent Name,
in and from which all wisdom and strength proceed.
One of their ancient professors said pretty loud, at the close of the meeting,
"`I thank God that I have once heard the Gospel of life and peace preached in its purity,
as it hath been this day.`"

It is with a deeply bowed heart I mention this and other circumstances of Divine regard,
spreading itself to the people in a wonderful manner.
I hope ever to remember it is the Lord`'s doings, and is humblingly marvellous in my eyes,
and I hope will be a means of encouragement to the humble seekers of Zion`'s prosperity,
to labour with diligence to keep clean the camp of God,
that its purity and safety may appear to those whom the
heavenly Power hath shaken in their false rests.
But, alas! there are too many of the professors of Truth who
are the greatest enemies to the cross of Christ,
by their corrupt conversation; and many others, though more morally clean,
dead in the root, and rather obstructions to the youth than helpers of their faith;
such as are unsound in various parts of our Christian testimony,
are leaders among the people; and the favour of the government,
in exempting Friends from the payment of priests`' wages,
hath been a lasting detriment to the cause here,
by a hasty admission of persons who desire to be made members.
Many are very desirous of an addition to their meetings,
even if they are not added to the Church of Christ, from views of a corrupt nature,
to make a figure in their neighbourhood, and perhaps bear rule in it,
and gradually get names on earth, and a share in the management of public affairs;
from which, however, they are totally excluded, and may they ever remain so.

There is a remnant of right-spirited people, of the youth and younger race,
who have at heart the cause of God, and the regulation of things amongst them,
with whom I have been united in labour, and helped to strengthen their hands,
having been at most of the monthly and quarterly meetings in New England,
and hope the Lord of mercy will graciously regard the cause of his truth,
and preserve a seed to his own praise.

4th.--On the evening of the 2nd instant, I got a meeting amongst Friends,
the inhabitants of this place,
which was to my satisfaction in the discharge of necessary duty;
and yesterday had two very large, solid meetings, to true satisfaction,
through heavenly help, which was great amongst us.

I am now clear of this place, which hath borne with weight upon my mind at times,
years before I left home, and hope some service hath been done.
May the gain and glory be wholly rendered to Him who alone is worthy;
it is he that is the staff and stay of his servants,
whether their feet are made beautiful upon the mountains, or dipped in Jordan.

With respect to martial affairs,
as they are remote from my business I meddle not with them,
but endeavour rather to draw out of that fire
and bustle too prevalent amongst the people.
An express arrived here last night,
with a confirmation of the news of General Braddock`'s total defeat,
with the loss of about seven hundred men killed, himself and sixty officers amongst them,
and the train of artillery, baggage, etc., belonging to the army;
he took along with him one thousand five hundred picked men,
and kept them together in the European manner; the French and Indians,
skulking behind the trees and logs of wood, destroyed the English,
who stood collected as a mark for some time, and then left their officers and ran away.
It is said the enemies were not above three
hundred in all--one hundred and fifty Indians,
and as many French.

Eighth month 19th, 1755.

My late indisposition confined me several months, which to me,
so little acquainted with ill health, was very distressing, both to body and mind,
and I have been often brought very low, and deeply bowed in mind,
where I have been made sensible of the supporting hand
of Divine help and consolation underneath,
in the most pinching times;
and the extension of gracious goodness has been towards me when in the greatest want,
for which gracious dealings, and the many favours and blessings received,
my soul begs I may be preserved in an humble and grateful remembrance of,
and for the remaining few days I have to spend, which I often think may not be many,
that I may be enabled to redouble my diligence in endeavouring
to walk worthy of the regard of our Heavenly Helper,
who, as leaned unto, will not only enable us to form good resolutions,
but to come up duly in the performance of them.

I take notice, with much thankfulness,
of thy kind concern and regard for me in the conduct of my worldly affairs,
and am duly sensible that thy very good advice springs from that Divine Fountain
that has hitherto freely flowed through thee to all the visited of God Our children,
through mercy, are in health,
and Heavenly Goodness is near to the tendering of the minds of many of them,
and the refreshing dew, I hope, rests upon the minds of those growing up.
It is my earnest prayer that we, their parents,
may be preserved in such a manner as to be exemplary
instruments in the hand of our Heavenly Father,
in their education in his fear,
and in training them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

Nine Partners, Ninth month, 1755.

In the fellowship of the suffering seed amongst you, I affectionately salute you,
and hereby inform you, that the situation of the Society in your parts, hath been,
since I parted from Rhode Island, the frequent and painful companion of my thoughts,
in which I have deeply looked to see how it might be helped,
and have carefully looked at the proposal of entering, in writing,
the names of such as are to be deemed members of our Society, which, upon the whole,
I cannot fully fall in with.
I believe, as through the remissness of the watchmen the present disorder hath entered,
by the labours of the watchmen the remedy must be obtained.
It appears to me the likeliest method to know who are of you,
will be to consider that all such who have a birthright in the Society,
or have been admitted upon request, or been employed in offices of the church,
must be deemed members, and under the care of Friends,
and that a visit be paid to all such as frequent meetings,
and have not a right to membership by the means aforesaid;
the visitors taking the queries agreed to last yearly meeting,
and solidly reading them to the parties, may acquaint them that those queries,
or the substance thereof, are universally agreed to amongst Friends everywhere,
as the rule of their outward conduct; and if they desire to be accepted as members,
it is expected they concur therewith, and be governed thereby; if such submit thereto,
and testify their concurrence by a personal appearance at the monthly meeting,
or to Friends`' satisfaction,
a minute may be made of their being deemed and accepted as members of the church.
If, on the contrary hand, any declare that they will not be governed by such rules,
after deliberate waiting, and visiting them, they ought to be deemed strangers to us,
and the Society no-ways answerable for their conduct; but as they belong not to us,
I cannot see the necessity of our making any minute against them.
This method, I apprehend, will fully distinguish who are of you, and who are not;
and if you find any, who by the aforementioned procedure are members,
who are spots in our feasts of charity, labour for their recovery;
and if they continue obstinate, place Truth`'s judgment upon them.

I believe, before Zion shines in her ancient glory,
judgment must begin at the house of God, and the refiner known among Levi`'s sons,
and the ancients of the house; and oh that none may obstruct its work,
and be found fighters against God, by obstructing his work in themselves or others.
The God of our fathers establish you more and more in his work,
and work amongst you to his praise and your comfort.

Warrington, Ninth month 24th, 1755.

My soul salutes thee in near and true affection,
and truly wishes thee a continuance of thy health,
and preservation through the various trials and difficulties
that Providence in his wisdom may see meet to allot thee;
so that neither heights, nor depths, nor whatever commotions may be amongst men,
may be able to move thee from that sure help that hath been with thee
hitherto--hath been thy battle-axe and weapons of war,
and hath covered thy head in the day of battle.
Mayest thou not be dismayed, though storms may arise,
and difficulties seem to surround thee on every side, yet stronger is He that is in us,
than he that is in the world, and more mighty than men, and can turn and overturn;
and let us poor mortals know that He, the Most High, rules on earth as well as in heaven;
that his works are works of wonder, and his ways past finding out.
My soul hath been bowed, and thoughtfulness has taken hold of my mind,
on hearing of the hurries and confusion on that side of the ocean;
yet never doubting but the righteous will be supported, will have a rock to flee to,
and a safe hiding-place and peaceful habitation that the world cannot deprive them of.
Yet is my soul bound in sympathy with thee, believing many difficulties may attend thee,
yet firmly believing thou art in thy proper place, and mayst,
in the hand of the Great Master, be made helpful to the weak,
and an encouragement to good Friends, who, I doubt not,
will be glad thy lot is cast among them.
Some of them I often remember with near regard.
I was pleased to hear thou got the company of dear John Pemberton,
and should be glad thou might be favoured with more of it;
ever since I saw him I thought him a hopeful youth, and I hope he will hold on his way.

I have had several Friends lodging here; we had the company of our worthy friend,
Edmund Peckover, two days.
I parted with him at Frandley; he has laboured closely amongst us,
and has had good service; the dew of his youth still rests upon him.

In the near and tender sense of that love which many waters cannot quench,
nor distance impair, I most affectionately salute thee,
having through the mercy of all-sufficient Help, never, I hope, to be forgotten,
still to continue the agreeable accounts of my progress,
under the sense of Heavenly protection every way, being supported in health,
to my thankful admiration,
and am now in better health and ability to labour than when I left home.
Friends think I am much stronger than when I arrived,
although I have travelled about six thousand miles in less than twelve months;
neither hath inward health been withheld, in the wise proportions of Infinite Knowledge,
whose ways are indeed unsearchable; although many painful baptisms,
for the dead and dying, have fallen to my lot, yet I have humble cause of rejoicing,
in hope that my labour for the help of others, and the obtaining true peace,
hath not been altogether in vain.
And although I have often to walk by faith, and not by sight,
or sense of much present feeling, yet the invisible, holy Stay is graciously near,
to give renewed testimonies.
I am separated from thee, for the cause of God and his Truth,
and we are both under his fatherly regard for good;
we can never be more safe than under his hand, and in his service.
I have now visited the province of New York, Long Island, Narraganset, Rhode Island,
and New England, pretty thoroughly, and had abundant labour,
both in the gospel ministry and the reestablishment of discipline.
I have visited some parts of the Jerseys,
and was at the yearly meeting at Philadelphia last week, to some good service;
the meeting was very large, and to great general satisfaction.
After the meeting, I came down directly with John Churchman to his house,
to enjoy a "`flat calm,`" as he expresses it.

I was often present, in spirit, with Friends at the Northern yearly meeting,
and pleased to hear it was satisfactory; though I believe, from some who were there,
there would be a great deal more of the bell than of the pomegranate.
But humbly thankful I am that there is a remnant left,
who have them placed about their robes in due number and proportion.
Some of that happy number I find here, and too many of a different sort.

[.salutation]
Dear friend Susanna Fothergill,

Thy dear husband was so good as to offer me this,
in order that I might have an opportunity to assure
thee that the tender regard and near unity which,
from our first acquaintance, made near impressions reciprocally on each of our minds,
to the laying a sure foundation of friendship, still remain as steadfast as ever;
and in a renewed sense thereof, my prayer to the Father of all our mercies is,
that He would still be pleased to preserve and keep us under the wing of his love,
and increase our affections in warmth to himself,
for therein stands the fellowship of all his children.
Thy dear husband, to my great satisfaction, has made a small tarry at my house,
in order to give rest to the body, which, by overmuch fatigue,
may be so debilitated as to be a clog to a willing spirit.
Perhaps these few lines, mean as they are,
may meet with no less acceptance for being joined to the foregoing epistle.
In much tender affection, in which my dear wife joins, I conclude, thy real friend,

East Nottingham, Tenth month 3rd, 1755.

Thou art the frequent companion of my thoughts, and that with hope and desire,
as for myself, that every degree of happiness may attend,
and that proportioned to the just sense thou hast received, wherein it alone consists.
I am thankful for the favour of thy recovery;
I cannot doubt thy awful remembrance of the supporting Hand,
and careful inquiry after the mind of Him,
who humbles to the brink of the grave and raises up again.
His mercies are unutterable, and demand reverent hearts.
O, that we may never forget what he hath done for us,
or be rendered unworthy of the further notice and regard of a
Being who remembers his children from generation to generation,
and supports through all their trials, to a peaceful habitation with himself.

I expect to spend this winter in these provinces:
not only in the continuance of bodily strength,
but the renewal of ability to labour in the Lord`'s work,
is my spirit bowed in humble worship.
Many are the painful steps amongst the dead and the dying I have to tread;
the heritage seems in some places almost laid waste,
through the negligence of those who call themselves watchmen,
who appear to me the very tail of the flock; and it seems as if,
whilst the people have made the outward wilderness as a fruitful field,
the plantation and garden of God has been made
as a neglected desert and barren wilderness.

There are a living remnant amongst the various classes in age,
who keep their garments clean, and are strong to labour in the Lord`'s work;
and work indeed there is, for all who are of a willing heart;
and I trust their labour will bring some advantage to the family,
and peace to themselves.

My good old faithful companion and servant,
who carried me two thousand three hundred miles last winter, whom I left in Virginia,
very near his exit, as I thought, hath been brought up to me here this week,
in tolerably good order; and I expect a great deal more service from him,
as my journeys will be shorter, and provisions plenty and good.
The poor old creature knew my voice when I spoke to him,
and gave all the signs of joy on meeting me that such a creature is capable of.

Dear sister,
I am abundantly sensible of the place I have in thine
and dear brother`'s affectionate remembrance;
though, perhaps, when sometimes in secret concealed distress,
and disappointed of hearing from you, a painful thought may be suggested,
and sometimes drop from my pen like a complaint, yet I know it is groundless,
am sensible of tender sympathy, and at times, in spirit,
as near as if a partaker of conversation with you both.
This intellectual union has been often relieving, and I am humbly thankful,
that though the tenderest affection reigns undiminished in my breast,
I have not an anxious wish towards England; this being, in the course of Providence,
my proper lot for the present.
I have now been about a week more than a year in this land,
and have travelled six thousand two hundred miles.
I intended to have transmitted to thee an account of my journey,
in the nature of a journal, but my time is so engrossed I have not time,
but have hitherto kept an account of my manner of spending each day since my arrival.

I am glad to hear a good account of the yearly meeting; I was daily present in spirit,
and in humble request for the overshadowing of best wisdom over you.

Maiden Creek, in Pennsylvania, Tenth month 20th, 1755.

The signal proofs of Divine help which have been extended towards me and others,
through my labours in the gospel service, will, I hope,
ever be remembered by me in the manner they ought, to my profit and encouragement,
in devotedness of heart to him who is ever
highly worthy of obedience and faithful service,
and will never send his servants out at their own expense, but amply supply,
out of his own inexhaustible treasure of riches, wisdom, and strength: indeed,
who is like him, or able to enrich as he?
Human understanding, glory, or friendship, are poor in possession, and in event.
But never-failing is the fountain of unchangeable good;
and though he feed his people with the rod, yet the nourishment is divinely sanctified,
and the flock of his heritage, though in the wood, is environed with invisible,
yet invincible salvation.

Since my last, I went down to a yearly meeting on the eastern shore of Maryland,
and returned with John Churchman to his house;
I have also proceeded through the western side of this province,
and have had many large and truly precious meetings,
although the service hath been laborious, amongst a people,
the elder part whereof seem not only dry, but very dry;
yet there is a number of young people of the Hebrew race coming up out of their dens,
and clothed upon with the vesture of righteousness and holy zeal;
and indeed the cause hath need of them.

Philadelphia, Eleventh month 6th, 1755.

I strongly hope He who hath called to this work will support
and enable me to bear it with resignation and patience,
and in his due time restore me to my beloved friends in my native land;
and in the mean time will preserve us living to himself
in the eternal covenant of light and life;
for abundant experience testifies that therein is our safety, beauty and use,
and proper capacity of yielding service to Him, who is worthy of obedience, worship,
and fear forever.
Abundantly good and gracious hath he vouchsafed to be to my soul,
in this painful labour in which I am engaged,
and hath often filled with his own holy rain to his heritage; and made, at times,
as a sharp threshing instrument in his hand, to thresh the lofty mountains to pieces,
and to bow the sturdy oaks of Bashan.
It hath been his own work and gracious condescension, and to him over all,
be the praise ascribed, who is God of the mountains, and lifter up of the low valleys,
and their distressed inhabitants.

I hinted that something would be likely to detain me longer than I once thought,
and I believe it will be my duty to visit all the monthly and
quarterly meetings within the verge of this yearly meeting.
It hath pleased the holy Master of our assemblies to clothe my spirit
with a concern for the renewal of the discipline in his family;
and he hath been near to direct in wisdom,
and to give me such a place amongst Friends here
as to open my way greatly in that respect;
and I believe in this service William Brown and John
Churchman will by turns favour me with their company,
which I esteem a favour.

I returned here to the quarterly meeting, which was very large,
and strongly good in various respects; and as the Assembly for the province have,
in some respects, I think, acted very inconsistently with the principles they profess,
I had a concern to have an opportunity with such of them as are members of our Society,
being twenty-eight out of thirty-six;
and they gave some Friends and me an opportunity
this morning to relieve our spirits to them.

Some of those parts I visited last winter are now in great confusion,
by reason of the Indians having done some mischief; they have destroyed several families,
and spread a general terror over the back inhabitants of this province;
and this city was, a few days ago,
alarmed by accounts of one thousand eight hundred French and
Indians being within seventy miles of this city,
on their march to it; but it was a false rumour.
But the deviation of many from our testimony,
and their desertion of an arm which has been their sure defence above seventy years,
and guarded them from hostile invasions and bloodshed,
and now leaning to their own strength,
and actually putting the people in arms in some places,
seems to me a presage of distress they will find hard to bear.
I expect you will have great rumours of mischief done by the Indians in this province;
but the latest and best accounts to this day,
do not amount to above ten or twelve killed;
but multitudes have fled from their habitations.

I was, some weeks ago, at a settlement of Friends beyond the Blue Mountains,
who were then in great quiet, but have since all removed, through fear of the Indians,
and left their plantations and dwellings desolate.
In the midst of this confusion, too few know the Rock of Defence,
or have confidence towards the Ruler of heaven and earth; their minds scattered,
and their foundations discovered very weak, having lost confidence in the Divine arm,
trust in their own.

From this account thou may sensibly judge of the painful labour I must undergo,
to obtain ease and discharge my duty: all the hardships of travel last winter,
though very great,
were nothing in comparison of the anguish of spirit I feel for this backsliding people,
though there are, and even in the Assembly, a number who remember,
with humble trust and confidence, the everlasting Protector of his people.

I dare not dissipate my strength by one wishful look toward my native land,
beloved wife and tender friends, so as to desire to see them;
but steadily and honestly labour here, according to the ability given;
circumscribing all my views within the bounds of duty, and resigning all my will,
power and faculties, unto the will of Heaven; who hath indeed,
been pleased often to renew wisdom and strength
beyond the usual proportion of my measure,
and to support, by his invincible arm, in many deep concealed trials.

I have no confidant here but the Lord alone; here are many worthy Friends,
and dear John Churchman is like bone of my bone;
but I have found it my safety and strength to be hidden and deeply
reserved from all unbosoming my complaints to any mortal,
and before the holy Eye alone to spread my cause.

Thou hast a right to know my secret heart, and canst enter into its chambers,
and in sympathy feel with and pray for my help;
and I know thou art inwardly bowed with me, and for me, to the Lord of help.

Brother Joseph`'s letter gave me great satisfaction,
on his own and dear sister Hannah and children`'s account,
towards all whom my heart is often filled with a
love which is not derived from mere nature,
and in the embraces of it they are often fresh in my mind;
but this is all I can at present find a way to manifest.
May all our dwelling be in that hidden root of communion
whence all the various branches derive nourishment,
and we shall be as epistles written on one another`'s hearts by the finger of God.

Chester, in Pennsylvania, Eleventh month 11th, 1755.

A variety of close, painful labour hereaway,
commands the attendance of every faculty of my soul and spirit;
though my affection to beloved relatives is undiminished,
and I am allowed at times to run in thought from one to another,
yet the painful sensation of absence hath been very much removed.
I esteem it a singular mercy from the everlasting fountain of mercy
thus to stay my mind in its proper centre--to hide my native land,
beloved friends, and each tender connection, within the veil,
to prevent a dissipation of mind to which I am too prone,
and to keep my strength collected and firm for the anxious labour of the day.

And, indeed, the sum of Divine mercies is unutterable,
of which my soul hath been made partaker, for my own and others`' help;
it hath been renewed from day to day.
in deep and wise proportions; sometimes more scarce and deeply hid from sight or sense,
to awaken awful research; sometimes more evidently manifest,
to confirm humble confidence in the all-sufficient Helper: thus deep,
memorable teaching hath been administered,
which I hope will not be forgotten in any future period of my life.
The continued support of bodily health claims thankful notice;
I never was more healthy than through this country.

I have been favoured with the profitable company of that truly great and good man,
John Churchman, in various meetings in this province,
and to be now and then my fellow traveller.

I have assigned sufficient reasons before,
why I dare not point out the time of my return home; it is concealed,
and I dare not attempt to draw the curtain.
I hope to be preserved steadily dependent upon Him who, I have reason to believe,
drew me out from all that is dear in life; and who, I trust, will, in his own time,
restore me to them again,
in the fruition of that peace which sweetly seasons every dispensation, and whose tender,
humbling effect is the strongest cement of the family of our Heavenly Father.
Thou knows, beloved sister, whose service I am in,
though unworthy to be ranked amongst his servants; and that he hath a right to be obeyed,
and devotedly served, whose power is over all, and his mercy is to those who fear him.
These considerations, with which thy mind is experimentally conversant,
will lead to a humble quietude and resignedness.

I am easy and quiet; I know I am not forgotten,
and that my dear friends are affectionately, and in true sympathy, mindful of me.
I feel the strongest reciprocal returns; may it ever be mutually cultivated,
and grow to the brightness of that friendship which is the
glorious fellowship of the inhabitants of Mount Zion.

I must conclude this testimony of near and tender remembrance.
My spirit is nearly united to thee in that which is stronger
than natural alliance--the hidden communion of souls,
rectified by wisdom, and refined by the power of redemption.

I spent most of last week with thy dear spouse,
and intend to set out this morning to meet him again.
He has his health, and looks much better than he used to do in his native land,
notwithstanding his deep labours, in body and spirit, which are great,
his testimony awakening and powerful,
and I think he grows in the root and solid substance.
His company is particularly acceptable, to solid friends, at this time of difficulty,
wherein his advice has been strengthening,
and his testimony clear and weighty against such that join with the world in spirit,
and in its carnal reasonings: too many of such there are,
that hearken to the clamours of the people, and are dismayed with the world`'s dismay.
Yet there are such that can, in humility and thankfulness,
say they are favoured with a quiet habitation.

Philadelphia, Eleventh month 24th, 1755.

Thus far peace hath attended my steps; excellent glory be ascribed to its Author!
Although the daily opening, through the spirit, of discerning the state of the meetings,
families, and at times of particular persons, hath subjected to pain and distress,
and more exercising than bodily fatigue;
yet the holy spring of counsel hath issued in its pure crystal streams, which,
though they have spread wide and freely flowed,
have not left the channel through which they run, dry and sandy;
but in due wise proportions both cleansed and made it
fruitful in inward enlargement of experience,
how to trust the sacred fountain for fresh supplies, improve those already administered,
and abide empty until the appointed time for replenishing come.

I received soon after I arrived here, a command and promise from my Lord and Master,
that I should make him atone my confidant,
and if he should communicate some pearls for my own use and treasure,
not to spread them to public view, but return them into his treasury undiminished.
And likewise, that in all my distressing, pinching hours,
I should to him alone unbosom my pain, and spread my hands towards his holy habitation;
and upon these conditions, and a faithful discharge of duty before him,
he would fill my treasury, and that with the riches of his own presence,
and hear in the day of trouble,
and enable patiently to possess my soul in the invisible
probations of companionship with his suffering seed.
Thus reserved and concealed, under the appearance of a cheerful, quiet countenance,
I have been helped to step along without making complaint to any,
or boasting of riches not my own.
It has created no confidants, but left me single from all, and by some, perhaps,
considered as void of much knowledge in my own private capacity,
and by others as an unnecessarily reserved and uncommunicative person.

But it hath tended to my peace and ease, and I have not wanted bread in my own house,
by an unnecessary profusion of it to such as perhaps had not teeth to chew it,
and would have been hurt by it if they had attempted to swallow it.

This simple, eternal truth, soon spoken or written,
but of extent inconceivable to the carnal mind, I have found my stay and comfort.
That God is good to the upright, sincere heart, and will not forsake them,
let their attainments be more or less splendid, or their stations what they may;
he will protect in summer`'s heat and winter`'s storms,
and though they may walk upon the waves, or be ready to sink in them,
if the petition be in good earnest.
Help, Lord, or I sink,
and a right disposition remain to lay hold of the outstretched hand, he will,
of his great mercy, renew as of old the expressions.
It is I, be not afraid.
My heart and pen have outrun my expectation in thus expressing my feelings,
but it is to those to whom I am allied by a connection nearer and stronger than nature,
who may perhaps read it with those emotions of friendship and
sympathy which I hope will ever furnish salt to our correspondence.

About four o`'clock in the morning, on the 18th instant,
this province was pretty generally alarmed with the shock of an earthquake,
which occasioned great consternation; but I do not hear of any damage that ensued,
unless the breaking of some chinaware and glasses.
I was then at Aaron Ashbridge`'s house, and being in some pain of mind,
my sleep was taken from me,
and thereby I was enabled to observe the progress of it with some accuracy.

I heard no noise like that of a rushing wind, which was heard in many places,
but a gentle shaking of my bed, in such a manner as convinced me what it was,
which continued to increase, and the windows, by the increasing trepidation of the earth,
began to rattle; some china, upon a chest of drawers, was moved pretty much,
as I conjectured; it gradually increased for one minute,
and opened the door of my chamber by drawing the bolt of the lock out of the staple.

As its increase was gradual, so was its decrease, and of the same duration, viz:
about one minute; it did not much exceed in all two minutes, nor was it any less.
I perceived the shocks of two earthquakes in England, and one upon Long Island,
in ninth month last, but they were little in comparison of this,
and not all of so long extent of time.
Here are numbers, as in England, who,
in order to take off any awful impressions from the people,
immediately resolve their being into natural causes,
lest the Lord of nature should be remembered and inquired after.
True it is, he hath commanded the subserviency of the elements to himself,
and his merciful regard to unworthy mankind;
yet hath he them in readiness to execute his purposes of chastisement and reproof.
Though they bear a part in the general song of praise to the author of their being,
yet at times their language relative to mortals is, "`My Father, shall I smite them?
Shall I smite them?`"

Very distracted is the present state of this province;
several cruel murders have been committed on the frontiers,
and sixteen people destroyed about the 9th instant,
within less than ninety miles of this city; which was done by a gang of banditti,
part Indians, with some Irish among them.
I was at the place about five weeks ago, but do not understand any Friends are hurt.
The five Indian nations who conquered the Delawares,
sold some part of the ancient inheritance of these last to the proprietors,
some few years since, alleging the right of sale to be in them as conquerors,
and the goods were divided amongst the five nations, principally,
to the discontent of the Delawares,
who still judged themselves justly entitled to some equivalent for their land,
which either the inattention of the proprietors, or their want of information,
induced them to disregard; and it is pretty much on this land,
and land fraudulently obtained, that the barbarities are committed.

Philadelphia, Eleventh month 24th, 1755.

I have, since my last,
been closely engaged in a part of this province adjacent to this city,
and been favoured with the renewing of blessed help, to labour in many large,
and I hope some of them memorable meetings, though in very deep, distressing,
painful service; but it is enough; and the sum of my desires, the Ebenezer of all ages,
is near, to strengthen, with the stretching out of his own glorious arm,
to enable to clear his own name, and the heads of his servants,
from the blood of the people.

On the 18th instant, this province was alarmed by a severe shock of an earthquake;
it is the second I have perceived in less than three months,
but the most alarming and terrible I have felt.

It fell upon me, in a vast congregation, last night, in this city,
to remind the inhabitants of this awful visitation,
with the sword now destroying upon their borders.
The subject was awful; and a very eminent degree of holy authority and wisdom attended,
to make it, I believe, memorably advantageous to some,
as it was melting to many hundreds present.
What livingly opened was fifth and sixth verses of the 19th Revelations.^
footnote:[And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,
all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters,
and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia;
for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Rev. 19:5-6.]
I mention it with reverent praise to the ever blessed Fountain of sure supply and help,
who, and who alone, is worthy of all honour, dominion, and preeminence forever.

Great is the perturbation of many, and plain the discovery now made,
of the unprofitable professions many have made of religion,
in this time of clamour and rumour of war;
few know where to have recourse for a rock of defence, and a safe hiding.
Agitated with fear and horror,
they feel their want of a good foundation in this time of need.
I hope it may be profitable to many in the issue, though,
for the present it is painful to such as are concerned to labour amongst them.
The fears of the people are not groundless,
nor hath any occasion been given to raise them to such a degree;
about seventy Indians have been known together,
who have burned several houses and scalped some people.
But I meddle not with these proceedings; they are not my province or business.

I remember thee and dear relations affectionately; and am sensible I have,
in this labour, the union and sympathy of many who are near to my spirit.
Dear Sarah Chorley has a place in my near regard.
I have often remembered her for the work`'s sake,
which the Lord hath begun and carried on in her mind,
and would and will perfect it as he is steadily looked to.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Lancaster, Twelfth month 13th, 1755.

Thy welfare every way is the concern of my mind, now,
in the absence of thy husband more particularly,
that thou maybe preserved daily in that which, above all things, will be thy wisdom,
strength, comfort, and support, both in spirituals and temporals.
I find great need of it myself,
having no other help to guide and instruct me in the proper way of my duty,
that I may make straight steps in my goings, both before God and man;
giving no occasion of just offence to any who may watch for it;
as there are many eyes over us poor preachers, some for good and some otherwise;
but truth will stand, over all the clamour and wrath of man; nay, the devil,
and all his instruments, cannot overthrow it; the foundation stands sure,
and the Lord knows them that are his, and will plead their cause in his own time and way.
But we have need of patience to wait that time; it may not be in our hasty time,
for our judgment sometimes is rash; but his is sure,
and lingereth not but for some good end: therefore, let us ever learn to submit all,
and commit our cause to Him who is just in all his ways;
let him freely dwell in our hearts, sway his sceptre,
and do his will for he will fight the battles of such.
I do not know why I should write after this manner; but as it freely comes, so it goes,
as unto a bosom friend, who is no stranger to those suffering paths,
nor to that Hand of power which worketh deliverance; into which I commit thee,
with my own soul.

Lydia Lancaster.

According to the eloquent testimony given forth concerning Lydia Lancaster,
and which was written by her intimate friend, Samuel Fothergill,
she was the daughter of Thomas and Dorothy Rawlinson, of Graithwaite, in Lancashire,
both of them descended from honourable families.
They were religiously concerned to instruct their children in the Truth,
the most precious of all blessings.
That powerful Hand, which can alone give the increase,
mercifully extended an excellent blessing to several of their children,
and particularly to this their daughter;
and as it opened the heart of Lydia in former time,
opened hers to receive the heavenly message.

About the age of fourteen years,
she had a sense of its being the will of Providence to
engage her in the ministerial service,
under which concern she continued about ten years, growing in wisdom and experience,
that she might come forth in the right time, endued with proper qualifications.
In the twenty-fourth year of her age she appeared in a living, powerful testimony,
and grew therein.
The blessed Author of all spiritual riches having abundantly
replenished her with the treasures of his kingdom,
she soon became an able dispenser thereof to the churches.
In this cause she visited this nation several times, Ireland and Scotland twice,
also the continent of America.

Her ministry was living, clear, and powerful;
her openings into the mysteries of the kingdom deep and instructive,
adapted to the state of those amongst whom she laboured; close,
and with authority to the negligent and careless:
yet all her ministry was attended with a degree of that love
and tenderness which accompanied her Lord and Master,
who "`came to seek and to save that which was lost.`"

Great was her growth in religious experience, even to the stability of salvation,
and an assurance that she should be preserved from falling;
yet accompanied with the deepest humility.
A filial love, which casts out servile fear, was the covering of her spirit,
and rested almost constantly upon her for several months before her removal.

She died at Lancaster, the 30th of the fifth month, 1761, aged seventy-eight,
and a minister about fifty-three years.

As she lived, so she died, in great favour both with God and man,
full of days and full of peace.

Philadelphia, Twelfth month 17th, 1755.

As the sure mercies of our Heavenly Father are new every morning,
conveying along with them renewed obligations to awful worship,
and some degree of holy ability to offer it to him,
and to make mention of his lovingkindness, even as a song in the night,
so the tender connections of nature, the stronger cement of friendship,
and a good degree of the deepest alliance in spiritual affinity, as a threefold cord,
draw into a communion and conversation which I hope will not be insipid or tedious.
The affectionate,
sympathizing spirit which I feel to run through and animate thy letters,
is to me inexpressibly pleasing.
I rejoice that I have a very affectionate sister, a tender friend,
and the Heavenly Husbandman a pleasant plant, united in one person.
And oh, that he who has done abundantly more for us than we could ask or expect, may,
on our part, be so reverently followed and served, that we may ever know him near,
to prune, cultivate, water, and replenish to greater fruitfulness,
and a happy translation at last to the banks of that river
which proceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb.

Through the continuance of Divine help, I am sustained in ability to travel;
my bodily health generally very well,
and spiritually according to the wise proportion of His wisdom,
who sends not his servants on an embassy at their own charge, but furnisheth meat, drink,
and apparel out of his inexhaustible magazine; even such provisions as are well prepared,
and such apparel as wears not out, but increaseth in lustre, as carefully watched,
and often washed,
until they acquire a meetness to appear in before the throne of unmixed Purity.
Oh that my heart might ever feel what it now suggests, through all the crooked,
intricate mazes of this wilderness passage, to a happy residence beyond danger.

A number of substantial Friends, from divers parts of this province,
having appointed a meeting for conference together, in this city,
and requesting my meeting them, I found some engagement of mind for the service.
Our conference continued, by several adjournments, until last evening.
The Friends met are generally returned, and I expected to go away tomorrow,
but feel my way blocked up, and an engagement of mind to remain here,
though I see not for what end; but as I am often led in ways too deep for my penetration,
I acquiesce in quietness and resignation of spirit.

A general visit to all the meetings (which I have almost perfected),
appears not to be the whole of my business here; one little service after another,
and not in the character of a minister, hath given me some true ease;
and hope to be helped to such a degree of attention to the great Master`'s requirings,
as to know, and by his strength perform, his will.

Philadelphia, Twelfth month 17th, 1755.

Oh that our residence may ever be in that house where the Feeder dwells,
and administers wise portions to his children, even bread that will never grow mouldy,
wine that is well refined, and garments that never wear out,
but increase in beauty and lustre the more they are worn,
until they are meet to appear even in the presence of unmixed Purity and terrible Glory.

Through the continuance of Divine favour, I am still helped, even beyond my expectation,
and supported to labour every way to true ease,
though very close and painful service falls to my lot, in doctrine and discipline.
The week before last, I visited all the monthly meetings in a neighbouring county.
We met at ten in the morning, and stayed until five in the evening,
without breaking up or refreshment, for five days successively,
which I think wore me more than any service I have had in this country;
but the strong Tower of the righteous was near,
and supplied with inward and outward health.

I am preserved from a painful hankering after home,
being stayed in my present service from a sure sense of duty, and a painful exercise.
My whole heart is engaged to follow after the things which make for true peace to myself,
the families`' health, and the renown of the ever worthy Name, who hath preserved,
and by his own hand sustained, to look towards his holy temple, in many trials,
and hath never failed.
Thou knows me too well to think I loiter away time; thy affectionate, repeated hints,
are tokens of a nearness which nature suggests not,
and an united spirit with me in this labour;
and mayst thou be remembered in thy lonely allotment
with the precious dew of the everlasting hills,
and the sweetness of that peace which surpasses the understanding of man.

As my spirit is bound to the testimony here,
I dare not attempt to hint much about the time of my return home.
I hope to return when I ought,
and to come sooner would not be to the ease or comfort of either of us.

The consternation in which this province hath been thrown by the Indians,
is not diminished.
The Assembly have sold their testimony as Friends to the people`'s fears,
and not gone far enough to satisfy them; the Indians have complained, without redress,
and are now up in arms, and have destroyed many people; there were the bodies of two men,
whom the Indians had killed and scalped, brought down in great parade to this city,
from the back parts; multitudes went to see them, and seem loudly to clamour for war.
The ancient methods of dealing with the Indians upon
the principles of equity and justice seem neglected,
the spirit of war and destruction endeavouring to break loose,
in order to reduce this pleasant, populous province to its ancient wilderness condition.

Few, very few there are to stand in the gap,
and spread innocent hands towards the holy sanctuary, in intercession for the people;
too many under our name, and even amongst our professed chiefs, unsound in the faith,
having lost their habitation in the fold of rest, are looking at, and calling for,
the arm of flesh, and the sword to defend them.

There are, nevertheless, a number who know how to pray, and where to flee.
Great is the opposition of spirit the ministers of the Gospel of peace must meet with,
and the doctrine of dependance upon the arm of the Lord is an unknown language to many;
this makes it very hard labour to divers,
to endeavour to awaken the people to consider their ways.

Wise, faithful, and true is He that dwells on high,
and will convince all people that he rules over all the children of men.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Philadelphia, Twelfth month 20th, 1755.

I have been deeply engaged in spirit and very closely employed in labour,
almost incessantly, since I parted with thee;
and so closely hath my mind been bound to the testimony, and my measure of labour in it,
as to prevent my attention to much else but the labour of the present day.
I durst not allow much scattering of mind,
even where the ties of nature were sacred and nearest.
I hope this may be accepted as the real cause of so long a silence;
but a degree of true nearness draws my attention towards thee,
thy dear wife and children, accompanied with an earnest desire for your preservation,
and sure building up in the Truth as it is in Jesus,
and that your care might be increased to look
forward beyond all settlements in profession,
and the outward courts of the temple, to that durable foundation and tried rock,
which is Jesus Christ, the Lord and giver of light and life.
Thereby you may be qualified to be useful in your day;
and being gathered up into the peace and rest of Mount Zion, may say to your children,
and others, by a living example, "`Come hither, I will show thee the bride,
the Lamb`'s wife.`"
Great is the want of such in your, as well as other parts of this land;
yet I am fully satisfied the Lord of salvation has arisen in sundry places,
to raise up their weak hands.
And oh, that you both may enough feel after the living, cleansing stream,
which would more evidently beautify and make fruitful,
trees his own right hand hath planted,
that obstructing things might be more and more removed.

Thus the Lord of the plantation would work for his name`'s sake,
even amongst some who have yet had little fruit upon them,
more and more abounding in inward and outward righteousness to the Lord and his family,
and lead gradually to a holy meetness to be at last fixed upon the banks of
that river which proceeds from the throne of God and of the Lamb.

Thus, in true earnestness of spirit, my soul longs for you both,
that the enduring riches of the Spirit of
everlasting love and life may fill your treasury,
and an increase of zeal and love towards the family may be known, wherein,
I am persuaded, the weight and burden of its welfare would be more felt,
and a concern to show yourselves on the Lord`'s side, in heavenly conversation,
and in a steady care for the cleansing of the camp, lamentably;
defiled by the spirit of the world in your island.
And although a sense of your own weakness,
and the difficulty of the labour may at times distressingly prevail,
yet the all-sufficient Supply of all would show himself near,
and endue with strength to labour to some help in general,
and true peace in your own individuals.
I believe good is towards you, yours, and the Lord`'s family;
and the ancient prophecy seems in measure accomplishing,
"`Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favour her, yea,
the set time is come.
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.`"

Happy, yea, inexpressibly happy, will be the portion of the truly faithful,
who devote themselves to his service with upright hearts.
The excuses of weakness are not available,
as the strength of the mighty arm of God will be revealed to the humble seekers,
who never said to Jacob, Seek my face in vain.

And, dear children, in true love, much desired and longed for,
may your spirits be awfully bowed to seek true riches, which are, I am persuaded,
at times offered from the Lord to your acceptance, and can alone beautify in his sight,
and in your own, when the veil will be rent, and things appear as they really are.
A gradual progress towards Zion,
from tender years to such a state as the Almighty may allot,
is the most secure and uniform, is more free from the depths of distress and anguish,
than where negligence and folly have attended their inconsiderate steps,
and they have the sorrow of unlearning, and the labour of learning,
in more advanced years.
Remember with love and fear the God of your lives, in the days of your youth,
that in the multitude of his mercies he may remember you,
and through his mercy you may be set as a seal on his arm.

Assure yourselves of a large share of true
regard with your affectionate friend and kinsman,

Philadelphia, Twelfth month 20th, 1755.

I have by no means forgotten thee, thy dear Hannah, and other relations.
I feel all the tenderness that nature requires,
and the warmth of strong desire for thy prosperity and
establishment in that blessed Truth,
into which thy feet have been measurably turned; and oh that thou mayest ever remember,
it is the followers of the Lamb that shall with him be victorious.
Many have known the arising of the Morning Star in their hearts,
and by the brightness thereof have been convinced,
and in a degree led into obedience and conformity,
yet for want of steady following on from one degree of faith and obedience to another,
have been darkened in their minds, and weak in their steps,
and rather by some crooked bypath turned back to Egyptian bondage,
than advanced forwards to that land of liberty,
the glimpses whereof have in time past been so precious,
that they have accounted all other things but as dross,
and of no value in comparison with it.

The retaining in our remembrance the joys of our morning, and what was once done for us,
hath prevailed at times as principal riches,
whereby the daily sacrifice hath been neglected, the feeling after living virtue stifled,
and religion gradually left the heart,
the poor soul contenting itself with notions and
conclusions it once saw in the light of life,
without waiting for daily renewings.
Thus form is substituted instead of power; the head enriched; but,
alas! the soul and spirit returned, or returning, to their common centre,
heretofore in a good degree crucified by the Holy Power, regain life and strength, and,
under a varied form, lead into alienation from God.

Unexpectedly, and unsought for, have these remarks dropped from my pen,
under a good degree of nearness of spirit to the Great Counsellor,
and perhaps not void of instruction to thee in thy present state; and oh, saith my soul,
that thy morning light may ever remain new and clear, that suffering distress,
and troubles on thy convincement, may not be rendered void of use,
and laid waste by the unfaithfulness of maturer age.
Have a care of the world, and its spirit; its friendships are enmity with,
and destructive of, that lamblike, innocent life which inherits all things.

Let not thy mind be encumbered with posts or places in the government;
they are not for thee; stand out of them all, in the ranks of the Lord`'s army; and thus,
I am persuaded, the Lord would bless thee, and others through thee.
But if this refining hand and chastity of mind be not rightly sought after,
and patiently abode under, I fear thy day will be overcast with clouds,
and perhaps scarce strength left to withstand even evident pollution.

At Joshua Pusey`'s, Twelfth month, 1755.

It is no small favour, amongst many others, to me, in my pilgrimage through this land,
that I feel the invisible cord which binds up the bundle of spikenard,
and find myself at times within it, though a favour not at all times attainable by me.
I am often scattered, and in an anxious solicitude,
whether I am meet for such a fellowship; and this is well,
in bringing more close search after the cause of obstruction;
which my soul desires may be removed by the spirit of judgment and of burning.
I have rejoiced at times in the sense of this fellowship,
in which I have desired my lot might be cast forever;
and though many bitter and unpalatable fruits grow in this land,
yet there is a garden which produces apples of gold,
and our Master has set a slip of this tree at Nottingham.
May his dew rest upon its branches, and former and latter rain render it ever fruitful,
and its branches spread over all opposing things, and poor I, favoured, now and then,
with a dish of its fruit.

This friendship thou hast vouchsafed to admit me to has done me good,
and I hope will continue beneficial,
in exciting to diligence to be what I know thou wishes for me;
and in the progression of that regard,
let thy knife as well as thy cruse of oil be upon me.

Wilmington, First month 12th, 1756.

Thou hast been so much the companion of my thoughts since I saw thee,
that I can hardly forbear telling thee so,
though I have little else at present before me to communicate; only this I may say,
my spirit is, and hath been, frequently touched with near sympathy with thee,
and strong desires for thy succour in the various exercises of thy pilgrimage;
for I believe thee secretly and strongly affected by them,
though outwardly favoured with many agreeable enjoyments of life.

And, indeed, unspeakably wise is the conduct of our Heavenly Father towards his children,
though we may at times injudiciously repine,
when some of his choicest blessings are handed out, under the form of adversity.
He knows our frame; past, present, and to come are one in his view,
and his wisdom directs their several contingencies to our profit.
Afflictions, when they arise from real, allowable causes, are at times made useful,
in renewing diligent labour after sacred relief; and truly profitable inquiries.
Is there not a cause?
have often issued in such discoveries as could scarce have been expected,
nor would have been received, in any other school.

Here is the faith and patience of the saints exercised, and rewarded in His time and way,
who slumbereth not in the darkest night of probation,
but Immanuel is his holy attribute forever.

My spirit strongly begs every dispensation of our Heavenly
Father`'s good pleasure may be effectually blessed,
in our obedience, to our help;
and I am abundantly satisfied his hand is towards thee for good;
and comfortable hope arises in my heart, thy day is near to break forth more pleasantly;
and the cloud which may, perhaps, have been on thy tabernacle, will be taken up,
as a signal for thy progress.

The benefit and satisfaction I have enjoyed from the

have interested me in those near friends whom he hath left behind.

I feel assured of thy partaking sensibly of that reward which
Infinite Wisdom and Goodness graciously affords to such who
deny themselves of the most precious enjoyments,
in the discharge of those duties enjoined by the wise dispensations of his providence,
for the benefit of their fellow mortals.

The many excellent qualifications thy dear spouse is favoured with, being,
with a steady devotion of heart,
employed in the cause and service of the bounteous author of them,
are so signally rendered serviceable to us, in these parts of the world,
by the renewed supplies of Divine instruction and strength, daily extended to him,
that many have cause reverently to acknowledge the condescension of Divine regard,
in sending him among us in a time of great difficulty, when every help,
mediate and immediate, is necessary: and I hope in due time,
when his service here is over, the prospect of which does not yet seem near in view,
he will be safely restored to thee, full of the most perfect tranquillity, peace,

East Nottingham, Pennsylvania, First month 19th, 1756.

Though I have nothing to boast of, as signal fruits of my close labour, to others,
yet the peaceable fruits of honest obedience are an abundant compensation,
and spread a table in the desert, at times,
that is more worth than that the devils are cast out, and that I tread on serpents;
the sweet evidence of a name in the Lamb`'s book of life, is the sum and substance of all.
I mention it with reverence; not as though I had already fully apprehended,
but as a mark which is to be arrived at by faith and obedience.
Oh, that it may ever be the chief object of our endeavours,
with united diligence and care, that we may go up hand in hand to Mount Zion,
the Heavenly Jerusalem, where those who overcome inherit all things.

And although painful baptisms, and times of great inward distress,
continue at times my lot, yet I am helped to be comfortably easy and resigned,
being sensible they are necessary for my own cleansing,
and right qualification to minister to others in their various states,
and suitable ballast for those times of more
sensible manifestations of the Holy Countenance;
for such, even to a glorious degree, are at times vouchsafed,
but they are the festival days of Zion,
and only come in the wise appointment of the king and ruler of that heavenly city.

I know thy heart is as mine, and thy desires strong that my return may be in true peace,
and hope we shall both be preserved from repining at the disposal of that Hand,
from whence a multitude of unmerited mercies have proceeded.
The present state of this province is very distressing; the Indians,
very cruel and bloody, destroying men, women, and children, and burning their houses;
which hath occasioned great trouble,
and raised the clamour of the people against Friends,
who dare not resist violence with violence.
Yet too few lay it properly to heart, and learn righteousness.
A choice seed there is, who spread innocent, interceding hands towards the holy temple,
with which my very soul is united,
and that seems likely to detain me longer amongst them than otherwise I might be.

The ingratitude of many to a merciful benefactor,
their worldly mindedness and forgetfullness of the Lord God of their fathers,
is cause of awful alarm from him who justly
challengeth the love and obedience of all flesh,
and will get himself a name in the earth, in mercy or judgment,
and be heard by all flesh.
Oh that this people were wise, and knew this.

The Assembly here have passed a law imposing a tax upon the inhabitants of this province;
and as a great part of the money is to be laid out for military purposes,
many solid Friends cannot pay it,
which is likely to bring such a breach and division as
never happened among us since we were a people;
may it be finally conducive to the glory of the ever worthy Name,
if it issue in the winnowing of the people.

I still continue very healthy for the most part,
though I have travelled and spent myself as much as most,
having travelled seven thousand miles in this country.
The winter proving favorable, thus far I have not been willing to lie by,
but intend two days entire rest here,
which is more than I have had at one time for some months.

Lancaster, Second month 10th, 1756.

In the pure fellowship of the gospel of peace, my soul nearly salutes thee;
having thee in daily remembrance, and according to my measure,
travailing in spirit and sympathizing with thee in thy painful and laborious service,
and under thy many heavy burdens, which, though great, will, I doubt not,
be sweetened to thee, and beneficial to many.
I pray, in my soul, thou may not faint in thy mind, nor be weary in well doing thy duty,
according to Divine manifestation; for whether the people will all hear or forbear, thou,
and all the faithful, shall reap in due time, not sorrow and perplexity, but glory,
honour, and peace.

O, my truly beloved friend, whom the great Lord of the harvest hath sent,
as a cloud full of rain, into that wilderness country,
I beg thou may be enabled every way to quit thyself fully,
by discharging thy trust honestly, that when it is thy time to return,
it may be with pure clearness and lasting comfort; yea, and I believe it will be so.
I am extremely obliged to thee for writing so plain, free,
and informing a letter as thy last to me was; indeed, I prize it much.
I now send thee a renewed token of that love
which neither time nor distance can diminish;
for I feel the length and strength of it to increase, and rejoice in my heart,
with a spring of praises, to the Fountain and Author of our mercies,
whose presence attends his depending children all the world over,
under their various afflictions and trials.
Great cause have we humbly to trust in Him, in a daily, patient waiting upon him,
to know his pure will; and such have cause many times to rejoice in his salvation.

As to the state of affairs in America, I do not think myself a proper judge;
but think our people had better have quitted their places in the Assembly,
as the world is circumstanced.
They are in a strait and very difficult station:
I see not how Friends can faithfully bear up the ancient testimony,
without being loudly cried against; wherefore, if they could be free to resign,
and live in peace and quietness, minding their own business,
as Friends do everywhere else, seems to me most agreeable;
as I wrote to thee once before, so shall leave it;
and let thee know I had a late letter from Edmund Peckover,
giving an account of an extraordinary visitation from on high,
extended to the people at Norwich.
In two years time are come forth in public testimony to the number often,
all well approved; among whom is E. G., from a state of mind far from agreeable,
is reduced to the greatest humility, and as a weaned child,
is in much self-abasement and abhorrence.
He appears in their great meetings, to the satisfaction and joy of Friends,
and agreeable surprise of every body;
and that there is such an open door of convincement,
that he thinks it may be said there are almost daily some added to the faith.

As to the times outwardly, things look very threatening,
and I expect a war with the French this ensuing spring and summer.
May it please the King of kings to defend and protect us by his Almighty power,
as I have reason to hope he will,
(all those who are really his,) yet I believe it will be a
time of such calamity as this our native land never knew;
and yet there is a secret hope in me that it will all work together for good,
to those who truly love God, and labour for Zion`'s prosperity,
and the enlargement of her borders.
There is a tender visitation to many of the youth in this nation;
and I believe the time that is approaching will shake, sift,
and loosen the wordlings from their too eager pursuit
and love of what will be found in a tottering condition;
that they must either fasten close to the ancient foundation, or else fall; nay,
I hope many will be awakened to righteousness,
and have more room for religious consideration than heretofore;
for it hath long been a dull, drowsy time,
and little more witnessed than the name of religion;
but the great God is jealous of his honour, and will not be mocked.
Deep and ponderous have the meditations of my heart been for months past,
and much satisfaction from the Lord has been met with.

I now conclude,
with a heart more furnished with crystal streams of love and
pure prayers than pen and language can set forth;
wherein I remain thy true and faithful friend, sister,
and companion in the sufferings of Jesus, and joy of our Lord according to my measure,

footnote:[This Friend resided in New England, and attained to a great age.
The following account of her is taken from a letter written in Eighth month, 1812,
by Matthew Franklin:--"`We called to see Comfort Collins,
aged one hundred and one years and eight months.
A more interesting and precious opportunity I never remember.
All her faculties have, in a measure, fled, save her religious sensibility;
she has no sort of recollection that she ever had either husband or children, or houses,
or lands, nor of her nearest friends even, when named; yet her sense of Divine good,
and the religious fervour of her mind, are unabated.
"`We stayed about an hour, the whole of which time she was engaged in praising her Maker,
in exhorting us to love the Lord, and to lay up treasure in the heavens;
several times saying, '`One hour in his presence is better than a thousand elsewhere:
I know it, friends,
I know it from experience,`' and then her voice
would seem to die away in a kind of melody;
and after being still a few moments,
she would again lift up her voice with much sweetness in praising the Lord,
and advising us to love and fear him; and looking round upon us said, '`I love you,
dear friends, though you are strangers to me; for I love them that love the Lord,
blessed be his name!`' "`The whole company were in tears whilst we stayed.
The remembrance of this season is not off my mind; nor, I hope, ever will be,
while memory remains,
for I think that she and Mary Griffin are two most memorable instances of
the reality and rectitude of the principles of spiritual light and life.`"
The time of her decease has not been ascertained.]

New York, Second month 12th, 1756.

In a degree of that love wherewith our Heavenly Father hath loved us,
and sought us out when our feet were turned from the paths of peace,
I affectionately salute thee; earnestly desiring thy preservation and establishment,
that neither heights nor depths may remove thee from the safe abiding of the faithful.
Various are the trials, and manifold the afflictions a remnant have to pass through,
in their journey towards Zion; some more manifest than others; some within, some without,
and some both.
But here is the faith and patience of the saints,
that nothing may move them from their trust;
and these present afflictions may work for us a more exceeding weight of glory.
Large hath been thy share in probations and trouble;
but he who led Israel through Jordan,
and commanded her waters to stand as walls on each hand,
hath an everlasting name in his family,
and will be his poor children`'s guide through Jordan`'s waves and depths,
and establish on the firm land of salvation, as humbly followed and trusted in;
and when their hearts may be overwhelmed, will lead to a rock which is higher than they.

It behooves us, dear friend, in order to share so great salvation,
to be obedient children of our Heavenly Father, to wait for his counsel,
and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, to purge and redeem,
that we may have a claim as children, to the Father`'s promise,
"`I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.`"

With respect to myself,
I am mercifully sustained in health and ability to proceed
with diligence in the Heavenly Master`'s employment.
I thoroughly visited Chester county; performed a second visit, to my great satisfaction,
to the western shore of Maryland, and through the Jerseys, to this city.
I stand ready to go any where that truth leads, and light shines;
but think I am near clear of this land; and have this evidence--I have, in my measure,
laboured faithfully.
I have seldom known a greater share of the word of life than
hath attended in this journey from Philadelphia hither,
which hath been about three weeks; nor more frequent scarcity of bread out of meetings,
so that I have been ready to say, notwithstanding all my labours,
"`I am cast out of thy sight, oh Lord, and in sorrow sought my beloved,
and for times could not find him.`"
But I believe his pitying eye and gracious ear are open, for good towards Zion`'s dust,
and his arm invisibly near when our heads are overwhelmed by the waters of bitterness.

My dear love in the unchangeable covenant of life,
salutes the living amongst Friends thereaway.
May the mighty God of Jacob preserve in holy, humble waiting,
and sustain to his own praise, and keep in his own meekness, wisdom, and purity,
that in days of mourning and lamentation for the slain and dying,
this land may have to spread innocent hands towards the holy throne,
that he may spare his people, and that they may never be a prey to the Gentiles,
neither inwardly nor outwardly.
So be it, oh Lord God!

I am, with the salutation of true love, thy friend and brother in the faith, patience,
tribulation, and victory of the gospel,

Philadelphia, Second month 20th, 1756.

Although a variety of painful exercising steps are in the way of my duty and labour,
yet all-sufficiency is one of the attributes of our Heavenly Father;
and each of them is very deeply significant.
It is and has been cause of profitable humbling to my soul,
that sure mercy has so signally attended every way.
I know it is for his own name`'s sake, and his people`'s sake;
and may the praise and reverence due, forever arise to him alone, undiminished from me,
for I am not worthy of his so great condescension.
Neither, indeed, are the professors of his pure truth; and that, I hope,
some of them are awakened profitably to consider,
and have their hearts stirred up to apply for help to
more fruitfulness and diligent care after true support,
though of too many my hope is low.

Oh that we, who have tasted that He is good, may never forget him,
nor allow our palate to be vitiated by that which our
present and future experience will evince is not bread;
the artificial, imaginary dainties of this world`'s riches, honours, and friendship,
have too often been an ensnaring banquet,
to which even some of Zion`'s sons have sat down, tasted, and forgot their proper aliment.
But this thou knows; and may thou ever be guarded in the proper exercise of thy senses,
and thereby preserved healthy, and strong, and meet for that service,
which is of infinite importance and everlasting duration.

I wrote to thee from West-river, in Maryland.
I finished my second visit to that shore, and was enabled to leave it with great peace,
obtained through painful, faithful labour,
I returned to the quarterly meeting at Concord, for Chester county,
having travelled very hard, and was enabled, through merciful help,
to clear myself of that part of the province to great satisfaction;
the name of the Lord was gloriously high amongst us,
to the melting many of our spirits as into one heavenly lump.
I came here on the 11th, and have not been a day unemployed;
and have been favoured with some truly good meetings in this city.

The circumstances of this province still continue fluctuating and unpleasant.
Many thousand pounds of the province`'s money, have, by the Assembly`'s committee,
been laid out in erecting forts upon the frontiers, and placing men in them;
a step as prudent, and likely to be attended with as much success,
as an attempt to hedge out birds, or the deer.
The neighbourhoods of those forts have been, since their being erected,
the scenes of the greatest barbarity; in contempt and mockery of the attempt,
eleven people being destroyed a few days ago, within a mile of one of their forts.
Fresh matter of contest hath presented between the Assembly and the Governor,
The recruiting officers having enlisted the servants of the inhabitants, they have,
many of them, no means of following their several employments;
a great number will be ruined, and a greater still exceedingly prejudiced:
the Assembly have addressed the Governor respectfully, but received an evasive answer.
I so fully concurred with thy sentiments before thou imparted them,
about the pointed style of the Assembly`'s reply to the Governor,
as to improve every opportunity I could meet with,
to impress the necessity of decency and due respect upon such of the Assembly as I
could propose to myself to be likely to have any influence upon,
with the manifest inconsistency of every inflaming step, with their interest,
and with their religious profession.
I found many pained about it, and sensible it is wrong.
It is altogether imputed to B. Franklin, their principal penman; who,
I have sometimes thought, intended to render the Assembly contemptible,
and subject our religious Society to the imputation of want of respect to authority,
as a factious sort of people; and I fear he has gained his point.
But as the uneasiness of the minds of many in the Assembly with such language increases,
I believe they will for the future be more guarded.

Upper Springfield, Third month 5th, 1756.

If I have not, when personally conversant with thee,
given thee proofs of a real affectionate
sympathy in thy present afflicting circumstances,
thou mayest be assured it has not been the effect of disregard,
or occasioned by the want of that sensibility of others`' distress
which nature and principle have deeply fixed in my mind.

A continued chain of important reflections relative to the whole,
may have often diverted my attention from particulars, though not from thee; and, indeed,
I have found it expedient, as much as I could, to avoid much dissipation of mind,
that I might stand more collected for the labour of the day.

But I have ever desired the favour of a mind susceptible of others`' distress;
and chosen from the school of affliction to receive the tongue of the learned therein,
to speak a word in due season to the weary and pained.
That afflictions of body or mind are not joyous, for the present, to nature,
is a truth abundantly confessed,
yet that they are often sanctified to work a more exceeding weight of glory,
hath been fulfilled in the happy experience of multitudes.

The afflictions incident to these tabernacles of clay,
have often a painful effect upon the mind;
the weight of them sometimes raises distressing reflections,
and prevents our attention to the sole, suitable relief;
and when the Lord of our life intends wise instruction,
disquietude and secret repining induces the desponding mind to increase its perturbation,
by a fear that we are cast out of the notice of the Heavenly Father, forsaken of God,
and therefore afflicted.

Hereby we are prompted to wrest the inscriptions
Heaven has written upon all his messengers,
whether sickness or health, sorrow or joy,
and are in danger of defeating the end of their being sent.
What more particularly endangers our misconstruction of
the message of sickness and distress,
is its being sent in the time of sprightly, blooming youth, when the gayer,
easier scenes are most likely and more eligible; advanced years submit to it, of course,
but youth by force.
The language of Hezekiah upon such an occasion is very natural,
and the result of most minds in parallel circumstances: "`I said,
in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave,
I am deprived of the residue of my years.`"
Not only the gloomy prospect of nature`'s decay, and the dissolution of the body,
affected his mind, but a painful solicitude about an hereafter aggravated his sorrow,
even the fear of an exclusion from future joy: "`I said I shall not see the Lord,
even the Lord, in the land of the living.`"

Peradventure, dear Mary,
disquieting sentiments from both these awful
reflections may at times have supplied hours of anxiety;
and a combination of real causes of complaint,
aggravated by the anticipation of those suggested by fear,
may have furnished thee with a variety of fears;
and the vigilant accuser of the brethren improved the opportunity at times,
to cast down below the proper place.

What may conduce to remove the whole cause, is not in my power to prescribe,
but an affectionate regard may suggest; and I would hint moderate exercise,
as often as thou canst; the approaching season invites,
and the tender indulgence of affectionate parents will often furnish thee with the means;
endeavour to exert thyself,
and let not an apprehension of inability render thee incapable
of contributing all in thy power to thy restoration to health;
this, I believe, would tend to thy advantage,
and repair the breach in thy constitution a state of inaction may have occasioned.
Not only thy own advantage requires it,
but I believe it would happily tend to the comfort of an affectionate, worthy parent,
whose mind hath been exceedingly depressed by affliction for her dear children`'s sake;
thy indisposition, which thou could not prevent, and also thy poor brother`'s, having,
at times, been as much as she could bear, and indeed insupportable,
if Almighty regard had not sustained.

I am abundantly convinced the great Physician of souls is not far away from thee,
to help in the necessary hour, and as reverently inquired after,
will establish in innocence and virtue, and bring salvation and peace to thy house.
Though virtue is not hereditary,
yet the intercessions of religious parents are
often available on their children`'s account;
and I hope at least one of the successors of that worthy man of God, Robert Jordan,
may know and be happy with his God,
and may know the same result of anxiety Hezekiah knew: "`Thou hast, in love to my soul,
delivered it from the pit of destruction.`"

That all things work together for good to those who fear the Lord,
is an undeniable truth, if we, through impatience and inattention,
render not the visitation of Heaven unprofitable to us.
This consideration hath often induced my reverent kissing the rod,
and humble inquiry into that instruction which ever attends it:
who knows what scenes of temptation a confinement to a
sick chamber prevents our being tried with;
peradventure it may be the hollow of an Almighty hand,
hiding us until the causes of indignation are past by.
Yet when that is gone by, the call, "`My people,
come out of thy chambers,`" claims equal regard,
for we have various relations in life to discharge,
and holy diligence and watchfulness will be rewarded with a bulwark of defence;
and placed in the midst of this world and its commotions,
we shall know our situations to be as a garden enclosed.
Great is the want of such examples, though there are some yet preserved,
and I trust among the youth of thy sex an increasing number,
who know salvation as walls and bulwarks; and though little sisters,
yet in the lineage of the immortal family, and though weak,
surrounded with all-sufficiency;
and I hope thy place amongst these happy
relatives to the King in Zion will not be vacant,
here or hereafter.

My regard and strong desires for thee are more than I can express,
and hope accompanies my mind that thou wilt be helped to live to thy Creator,
be a comfort to such as may expect it from thee,
and know a time of more true relief every way.

Burlington, Third month, 1756.

I think I have very little worth notice to send thee,
but the token of affectionate remembrance,
in a degree of the revival of that love which never dies,
which at first baptized and united our spirits, and remains our joy,
and at times is cause of it one to another.
I believe, in proportion to our access to the Father of lights,
its lustre and animating rays will retain and increase their splendour,
and in times of traversing the gloomy, remote regions of the shadow of death,
its reflection, though not in direct lines, will be relieving, and its genuine,
though faint beams, convey hope.

The course of my experience, since I left Philadelphia,
hath taught me a practical paraphrase on what the Apostle meant by living by faith,
and at the same time all within me hath been repeatedly
humbled by the wise alternations of light and darkness.
Seldom, in my spiritual progress, in my own individual case,
am I more deeply poor out of meetings, and more reduced to a poor morsel of bread,
and sometimes not that, except the word of patience; and in meeting,
not often more opened in the powerful Word of Life; but alas!
I feel like a tube; some liquid, crystal stream runs through me to others,
but I doubt little remains.
May the cleansing efficacy of the holy stream purify the channel,
and run into that reservoir constructed by Eternal wisdom, out of my reach,
but whence he can water my garden, even with his foot.

I was favoured with some open, relieving times in Philadelphia.
I left that place on the 21st of last month,
and came hither to the quarterly meeting for ministers and elders, which was,
through very hard labour, at last well.
I was at Mount Holly on first-day, and in this town in the evening;
both meetings large and well; at the quarterly meeting here on second-day,
and the youths`' on third, both large, and the latter memorably comfortable.
On fourth-day, at the quarterly meeting for ministers and elders, at Wrightstown;
very close labour, but strength proportioned to the work: a large,
profitable meeting succeeded, held that evening in the court-house, at Newtown.

Next day the quarterly meeting, very large, and a thorough good meeting,
through manifest support in the extending of the fan and the axe,
and the oil of consecration to those who waited for it.
I left that county easy, and came to this place.
On seventh-day, had a large meeting in a Baptist meeting-house, about eleven miles off;
yesterday, a large meeting at Mansfield,
and this day a large and heavenly meeting at the monthly meeting here.

Our epistle from Philadelphia to the monthly meetings meets with a different reception,
as the people differ; the libertines, worldly-minded,
and opposers of the reformation in themselves and others, cavil and rage;
but the seed is relieved, and the honest-hearted are strengthened.
I see it will be a time of division between wheat and chaff,
and that we shall find some amongst the latter
we thought would have been more deeply weighty,
and perhaps the contrary in some other instances.
But the company, in which some who dissented from us find themselves left, will,
I believe, awaken some weak, honest hearts to ponder,
whether Divine wisdom hath changed the channel of
instrumental intelligence from its usual course,
by a living, sensible ministry, into the muddy pipes of the licentious.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Philadelphia, Fourth month 28th, 1756.

I often feel called upon, by the voice of unfeigned affection, to remember thee;
there is something in my mind stronger than +++[+++what]
mere nature inspires, which suggests strong and sincere desires for thee every way,
as for myself; and as thou well knows, from a measure of experience,
the path of true happiness,
may thy strength be renewed with the increase of thy knowledge,
that through all the intricacies and probations of life, thy race may be steady,
and its termination be within the everlasting gates of that city,
whose inhabitants are established in peace without alloy.

The first perception of approaching liberty to revisit my native land,
was allowed on my return from a laborious and
painful visit to the western shore of Maryland.
I never, until then, found myself at liberty,
or even much desirous to draw the curtain aside,
but it was then rather lifted up by the Master`'s hand, and a two-fold sense was given,
of peaceful approbation, and a view of release.
Nevertheless, my mind is quietly calm, yet under the weight of some remaining service,
and solemnly still, without any tumultuous emotion,
in the view of my again being personally conversant
with those to whom I am united in the ties of nature,
and the closer cement of grace.

I have gratefully and reverently to acknowledge,
that the unspeakable mercy of an all-sufficient Hand has been plentifully extended,
in such a manner as loudly to demand a humble abasement
and faithful subjection to his holy requirings.

Being made to know I go not in this warfare at my own expense,
but though spiritually without bag, scrip, staff, or shoes on my feet,
of my own providing, yet the inexhaustible store-house, armoury, and wardrobe,
where all the living generations have sought and received supplies,
is often opened to my humbling admiration; and though I have travelled at great expense,
the bag continues to be filled with fresh riches, the scrip with suitable bread,
and the staff strong to support in arduous, painful pilgrimage;
and though I have travelled amongst sharp, cutting rocks, rending thorns,
and even amongst scorpions and serpents, my feet are not bruised,
but shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and light.

I have not an exulting thought in my heart to appropriate
these favours to my own wisdom or worthiness,
but my exultation is in the name of Him whose mercy is unutterable,
and not at all proportioned to my merits, which would issue in eternal misery,
if interposing condescension averted not the stroke.
Oh! that every succeeding day of my life may produce a testimony of
my awful regard to the riches of Divine forgiveness.

I have had another smart attack of my old complaint; it was not of long duration,
confining me only eight days, but for four days exceedingly grievous pain in my side,
breast, and back.
It seized me at New York,
in a house where both inclination and ability
concurred to render me every service possible.
I was so disabled as not to be able to ride on horseback,
but came in a chaise from New York hither,
and in about fourteen days was bravely recovered.

Another circumstance it may not be improper to mention,
lest it should come some other way.
The day I came to New York, one of the ferry-boats was overset, and eleven people drowned.
As it was pretty generally known that I intended to cross the ferry that day,
it was suggested that I was amongst the people who were lost,
and the report circulated through the neighbouring provinces with surprising swiftness,
even down to Maryland in four days.
I was apprehensive some forward person might transmit it to England, and therefore,
with a grateful heart to the great and good Preserver, give thee and my friends,
if such a rumour should come, this intelligence.
I passed the ferry the same day in safety.
I had a meeting that day in the seat of government of the Jerseys,
in the Presbyterian meeting-house; the Governor, J. Belcher, procured it,
and attended the meeting.
I dined with him afterwards, and met with a kind, affectionate reception; he is old,
and his body enfeebled, but I think his immortal part not far from the kingdom.

I could not pass by this circumstance, as in that town, i. e. Elizabethtown,
our dear and worthy father met with bitter opposition when last here,
from the former priest, and with difficulty got a meeting in the place;
and such is the change, that the present priest voluntarily offered me, in his terms,
"`his pulpit.`"
I did not ascend his rostrum, but,
as no place could be procured equally large for the reception of the people,
accepted the house.
It was a day of memorable mercy, and I hope as such will be remembered.
The general spring meeting here was very large,
Friends from remote places coming to see and take leave of the Europeans,
and it was a great and good meeting in its various sittings.

Since that time I have travelled several hundred miles, visiting some fresh places,
and re-visiting others where I thought duty led,
and have now gone through all the provinces of North America,
as fully as any that ever came into these parts,
excepting one remote corner in New England, where are two small meetings.
Yet am I fastened here; Joshua Dixon sailed some days ago, in a vessel for London.
Some weeks ago I went aboard the vessel, but it seemed to me no place of rest,
nor my business here finished.
Joshua thought he was released, and the ship appeared pleasant.
I too, with humble submission, desire when I may, to return, but Mary Peisley,
Catharine Payton, and myself, felt our minds alike restrained from returning;
and although we now see little before us, yet we are bound to this place and land,
for what end we cannot fully see; but the Lord is with us,
and therein we desire humbly to acquiesce.

There are several very large quarterly meetings coming on,
which I am ready to believe will tend to our discharge.

The distress of this province is great--its commotions violent--all
the desolations of a cruel Indian war impending,
and the legislature in a great degree infatuated;
it seems like a judicial desertion of all their counsels,
and every step they take increases their perplexity.
Friends have interposed for the restoration of peace,
and borne their testimony faithfully;
I hope it will issue in their dismission from government,
their connection with which hath been of great dis-service of later
times to the real end of our being raised up as a peculiar people,
to bear our testimony to Him whose kingdom is in peace and righteousness.
The love of power, the ambition of superiority, the desire of exemption from suffering,
strongly operate with many under our name,
to continue in stations wherein they sacrifice their testimony,
and are as salt which hath lost its savour.
But as it now appears that we can scarcely keep the Truth and its testimony inviolate,
and retain those places, many stand up on the Lord`'s side,
and declare they have none on earth in comparison with the God of their fathers.

I am already sensible of perils amongst false brethren,
and am afraid they will be strengthened from your side of the water;
some letters are already received, disapproving Friends`' conduct here,
in a crisis in which there appeared to me an awful inquiry.
Who is on my side, who?

I intended to have written to dear brother, but am not allowed time;
the present posture of affairs is not to be described in a short compass,
and I cannot meddle with gathering a bundle of sticks
to lay upon a fire which already burns too fiercely,
lest I should gather a viper to bite my hand.

My dear love attends M. W., and what can I say to her that she knows not,
of the alone everlasting Husband and Judge for the widow and fatherless, whom she knows,
and who I humbly hope will not fail in this time of trial?
If any ask when I return home, I can only say, as soon as I can and bring peace with me;
that peace I have diligently sought;
and though the curtain long drawn between me and home, is at times a little drawn by,
yet I see not full liberty to leave this land,
but hope a few weeks more may set the seal of peace upon my dismission.

Philadelphia, Fourth month 29th, 1756.

I acknowledge with thankfulness the kind regard of our great Master,
in keeping us in quiet resignedness in this time of separation, for his cause`' sake,
and that he is present in the needful hour.
I might speak largely of his gracious dealings with me in this laborious service,
but I silently adore his hand, and crave his favours may be remembered by me,
and produce a testimony of daily and awful regard to the richness of his mercy.

I greatly rejoice to hear of some revival amongst you, and ardently wish preservation,
stability, and growth to every plant our Heavenly Father hath planted,
and I am abundantly convinced,
it will not be of the Lord that unfruitfulness and instability appear in any.
He would yet make Zion the joy of the whole earth.

I expect this is the last letter I shall send from these parts.
I am humbly thankful that the Hand which directed my
opening services on my first arrival here,
is near to help and strengthen to my own comfort; and I may reverently say,
he hath set before me an open door amongst this people, and they know,
and the Lord knows, I have not flattered them, nor coveted any marks of their regard.

The frontiers of Pennsylvania continue to be harassed by the barbarous Indians,
who destroy man, woman, and child;
all attempts to defend themselves against them seem vain,
and the means of restoring peace, (to wit) doing the Indians justice,
by fully paying them for their lands, were in the beginning shamefully neglected,
and will now be very difficult to bring about.

Unsearchable are the ways of Providence in the execution of his judgments,
and his steps in his holy sanctuary, to get himself a name: resentment, anger,
and destruction to their enemies, seem to be the general reply to this awful voice,
instead of a strict inquiry, "`Is there not a cause?`"
Oh that this and our mother country may both learn righteousness,
before the brandished sword of justice be unsheathed to their terrible chastisement!

East Nottingham, Fifth month 23rd, 1756.

There are but few of the many friends in England that I
more frequently remember than thee and thy dear brother,
and that with sincere desires that the God of Abraham, and of Isaac,
and of your own natural father,
may still remain to be the preparer and sanctifier of your hearts,
and that you may still remain to delight therein; this,
with a mind truly bounded and made content with the allotment of Providence,
is great gain indeed.
Our whole life, from earth to heaven, should be one continual travel,
and as our heart`'s desire is towards, and our eye fixed on,
the mark of the prize that is before us, and this object continues rising,
so the world is left further and further behind, and grows, as to its enticing things,
smaller and smaller.

Your dear brother has made an honest visit to the churches in America,
and if he has not much increased in words and fine eloquence,
I am sensible he has improved in the root of living ministry,
and has been baptized into the states of the people,
as much as any I ever knew from Europe, and I think, though I love him nearly,
my judgment is not biassed by the warm regard I have for him;
we may value one another for the work`'s sake,
but there is no praise due to man for the excellency of the gift, for every gift,
good and perfect, comes from God;
in humble reverence let him alone be therefore praised forever,
and all his own works will praise him who is worthy forever and ever.

Dear friend, thy countenance is as familiar to me at this hour,
as it was when I enjoyed that quiet rest at your house, so very acceptable to me,
being almost worn out,
and your singular kindness and regard can never be forgotten by me; at seasons,
whilst I was in London, I felt very poor and worthless,
and tender usage makes deep impressions; I acknowledge,
had it not been for such humbling seasons, whereby I was taught to know myself,
I had been less worth than I at present am.
Perhaps it may be some encouragement to thee to know that some
others have been taught to think meanly of themselves,
when, for their trial, their Life has withdrawn himself,
and left them to view their own imperfections.

Sixth month, 1756.

Though I am a stranger to thy person, yet not so to the good character thou bears,
therefore I find freedom to send thee a recital of the close,
prophetic warning of approaching trials, which was delivered to a large auditory,
at the time of our quarterly meeting at Philadelphia, by thy brother,
soon after his arrival,
when not so much as a handsbreadth of cloud appeared over our land;
but in a short time a storm arose and fell heavy on many within our borders.
As the subject was solemn, so was he quite great in the delivery of it,
which was to the following effect, viz:--A holy commemoration of God`'s kind dealings,
formerly, and latterly, to this our thriving colony; aptly comparing it to the vineyard,
the Lord thereof had in a very fruitful hill, which, after clearing and fencing,
he planted with the choicest vine;
such indeed were the first inhabitants of Pennsylvania, men of excellent talents,
both natural and divine;--when, looking for fruit, behold it brought forth wild grapes.
He then queried, what more could have been done for a people than had been done for us?
He besought us to consider what fruit we were bringing forth?--if sour grapes,
we might expect the fence should be taken down,
and we trodden and laid waste:--signifying that such would be our case,
if not prevented by timely repentance and amendment of life.
Such, indeed, was the force of Divine evidence which attended him,
that Friends`' minds were seized with awful dread, and had to say to each other,
after meeting: Is this the last warning that we are to receive?
It seems so like that of Jeremiah to the Jews, just before the destruction of Jerusalem!

The first time I had an opportunity to hear him I thought he flew high,
even to the third heaven; when a pang of slavish fear took me,
and I had liked to have wished him there for good and all; that is,
safe in his heavenly mansion; but I was stopped,
and bid not to pray that he should be taken out of the world,
but to breathe for his instruction while in it
which I did with all the little ability I had.
But when I had opportunity to observe his humble, watchful conduct,
like one always walking in fear, my fear, before mentioned, was entirely removed.

He is now going to leave us, who are so nearly united to him,
that bidding him farewell seems a heavy task to me and mine;
that sweet flow of divine love which frequently passes through his heart to his auditory,
endears him to all, both saints and sinners.

There is a fine company of them going together.
Those precious ministers, Mary Peisley, and Catharine Payton,
whose services were great in these parts of the world, and also our dear ancient friend,
Abraham Farrington, and Samuel Emlen, junior.

As love for a long time hath been grown in my heart to thy worthy father, who,
of all men, struck the deepest impressions, in a religious sense, on my mind,
so it is matter of rejoicing to me to hear of the welfare of his family.
I often do believe God has a peculiar regard to the seed of the righteous; such,
dear friends, you are.
May the blessing of your father`'s God rest plentifully on all your heads.

[.signed-section-closing]
Accept of the love of one of thy father`'s old friends,

In several of the preceding letters, mention is made of the alarm which then prevailed,
on account of the inroads made by the Indians on the back
settlements of Pennsylvania and some neighbouring states.
It was a time of war between England and France,
and the French authorities in Canada had engaged
some of the Indian tribes in this warfare.

The city of Philadelphia, in particular, was in a state of much excitement;
the defeat and death of General Braddock; the devastations committed by the Indians,
and the fear that they and their allies might even attack the city itself,
caused great and general alarm.

Friends were under an exercise of mind,
not only that all the members of the Society might be kept
quiet and faithful in support of its testimony against all war,
but were also much engaged in interceding and making
efforts with the Government and with the Indian chiefs,
with whom they had great influence, to prevent a general Indian warfare.
Another cause of anxiety was an impost or war tax,
which the Assembly had laid upon the inhabitants,
by which Friends were brought into considerable difficulty.

Samuel Fothergill, as was often acknowledged,
was very helpful to Friends under these circumstances; aiding them with his counsel,
and frequently engaged in earnest exhortations for all to
remain faithful in support of their Christian testimony.
"`If the potsherds of the earth clash together, let them clash!`" was his language;
and his charge in particular to Friends was to abide in their tents,
and not so much as to look outward,
but to avoid and keep clear of everything contrary to
the peaceable spirit of the gospel of Christ;
and thus to show themselves his true disciples.

He joined with several other Friends in signing and
issuing at this time an epistle of advice and caution.
He also united with Friends in their efforts to preserve the peace of the colony,
and in particular to prevent the Indians from becoming engaged in the war.
These efforts were frequent and strenuous, but proved unavailing.
In his Journal are the following entries:

"`Fourth month 9th, 1756.--Had some labour amongst Friends,
to endeavour to prevent a cruel Indian war;
and had also a conference with the present and late Governor, along with John Pemberton,
upon the present posture of affairs; they received us with candour,
but our labour was ineffectual, for on the "`10th,
a day to be remembered through many generations with sorrow,
the Governor agreed to proclaim war against the Delawares,
and delivered the hatchet into the hands of some of the Indians.`"

This conclusion on the part of the government,
was the source of much distress to Friends in general;
and Samuel Fothergill largely partook of it.
He, Catharine Payton, and Mary Peisley,
during one of their earlier visits to Philadelphia,
were in that city when the first soldiers who had
received their commission from the English government,
arrived there, under the command of General Braddock.
The circumstance excited considerable attention,
and is thus mentioned by Catharine Payton,
in her Journal:--"`I said a cloud of darkness came with them.
The Lord had settled this colony by peaceable means;
he hath hitherto protected it by his own Almighty arm, and it prospered greatly;
but henceforward disunion and disturbance prevailed and increased in it.
Our friend, Samuel Fothergill, as well as we,
were strongly and affectionately engaged to promote peace,
and guard them against the event, which he feared would ensue,
and which in time followed.`"

The general Spring meeting held in Philadelphia, (1756,) was very numerously attended,
and was a solemn, instructive meeting; in which the Friends,
whose labours in America were now nearly accomplished, had considerable service,
and in the love of the gospel, took a solemn and affectionate leave,
and soon afterwards embarked for Europe.

On board the Snow Polly, near Bombay-Hook, Sixth month, 1756.

Thy very acceptable salutation,
I read in that love and affection in which I am sure it was written;
and I trust the pure friendship, hitherto subsisting since our first acquaintance,
will often receive a holy stimulus as we have recourse
to its inexhaustible source with suitable frequency,
and furnish us with both inclination and ability to converse together,
when we must be necessarily separated in body: for I think, whilst I am in the body,
I shall never forget the regard and sympathy thou hast manifested;
and although the heavenly approbation is the most to be prized and sought after,
yet the pure fellowship of the brotherhood is a stream
from that eminent spring whence all good proceeds;
and even the fellowship of the saints on high, in the Father`'s love,
is a part of their felicity,
I have taken my leave of America with peace and quietude of mind.
I have some sea store, but not to profusion.
I beg wisdom to husband it well, that I may carry some of it home,
and know it blessed when I come there.
I have sometimes deeply inquired into my own state, and feared an apostacy,
in that the ecstacies of joy, heretofore very often renewed,
have of late time very much abated.
It hath taught profitable inquiries,
and hath sometimes appeared not to be occasioned by declension,
but by a solid equanimity in enlargement of experience,
and more productive of stable joy and fixedness,
than the variable circumstances attending the former.
I boast not of my growth, for I have not overgrown a variety of painful weaknesses.
I am easy with a solid review of my journey,
and believe I shall very frequently remember many of you in love unfeigned.

The last entry in Samuel Fothergill`'s Journal is this:--"`5th of sixth month,
1756.--Came on board the vessel Charming Polly, John Troy, master,
bound for Dublin.--Left this land, with peace and holy quiet.`"

Thus concluded, with that reward he had so earnestly desired, and so diligently sought,
the visit of Samuel Fothergill to America:-- a visit,
during which he had faithfully and honestly laboured,
and wherein he spake diligently the things of the Lord; he had taught publicly,
and from house to house, and had not shunned to declare all the counsel of God.

To many in that land he had become bound by the strong ties of Christian love;
this bond was mutual, and terminated but with life itself.
Many were the proofs and testimonies reciprocally given of this feeling;
several more public testimonials were also issued by his friends,
of their approbation of his labours amongst them.^
footnote:[The following certificates, which he brought from various meetings,
are amongst the records of Hardshaw monthly meeting, viz:
-- From the monthly meeting of Hopewell, held at Opechan, in the county of Frederick,
Virginia.
From the quarterly meeting held at Symonses Creek, North Carolina.
From the monthly meeting held at Frederickburgh, South Carolina.
From the yearly meeting held at Nancemond, Virginia.
From the yearly meeting held at West river, in Maryland.
From the quarterly meeting held at Portsmouth, Rhode Island.
From the quarterly meeting held at Flushing, in Long Island, New York.
From the quarterly meeting held at Burlington, New Jersey.
From the monthly meeting held in Philadelphia, 28th of fifth month, 1756.
(This is signed by eighty men Friends.) The tenor of these
documents is,--"`That his public labours amongst us,
both in the ministry and the discipline, have been fervent, deep, and lively;
to the edification and building up of the Church, the information of strangers,
and to the great satisfaction of such as wish well to Zion`'s cause.`"
According to the account kept in his Journal, he had travelled,
during his visit in America, eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-five miles.]

The vessel in which the Friends embarked had a comparatively quick,
though rather a a stormy passage, of thirty-four days.
The waves, at times, dashed over into the cabin.
Notwithstanding the stormy weather,
they had many good and precious meetings during the voyage,
some of which were attended by the master and sailors.

It being a time of war, several French privateers were in the Irish channel;
they were favoured to avoid these, and to arrive in safety at Dublin,
on the 9th of the seventh month, 1756.

Samuel Fothergill to his Wife.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Dublin, Seventh month 10th, 1756.

I salute thee in the tenderest affection,
and hereby inform thee of my safe arrival in this city,
after a good passage of five weeks, in which time I have been, and yet am,
greatly favoured with health, and a degree of that holy peace which passes understanding.
Glory and praise to His adorable name, who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters,
and is the defence of his people forever.

They were detained in Dublin upwards of two weeks.
On the 25th of seventh month,
Samuel Fothergill and Catharine Payton embarked for Holyhead,
and proceeded thence to Chester.
Here they parted: and on the 29th of that month,
Samuel Fothergill was favoured to reach in safety his own house at Warrington.
